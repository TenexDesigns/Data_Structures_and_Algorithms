In programming, a "bit" is the most basic unit of data and represents the state of a binary digit, which can either be 0 or 1. The term "bit" is a contraction of "binary digit."

In the context of the example provided for checking if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations (`(n & (n - 1)) === 0`), understanding bitwise operations is key.

### Bitwise Operations:

Bitwise operations manipulate individual bits within binary representations of numbers. Here are some common bitwise operations:

1. **Bitwise AND (`&`):** Performs a logical AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

   ```typescript
   const result = 5 & 3; // Binary: 0101 & 0011 = 0001
   console.log(result); // Output: 1
   ```

2. **Bitwise OR (`|`):** Performs a logical OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If at least one bit is 1, the result is 1.

   ```typescript
   const result = 5 | 3; // Binary: 0101 | 0011 = 0111
   console.log(result); // Output: 7
   ```

3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`):** Performs a logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If the bits are different, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

   ```typescript
   const result = 5 ^ 3; // Binary: 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110
   console.log(result); // Output: 6
   ```

4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`):** Inverts the bits, changing 1s to 0s and vice versa.

   ```typescript
   const result = ~5; // Binary: ~0101 = 1010 (in 2's complement)
   console.log(result); // Output: -6 (in decimal, due to 2's complement)
   ```

### Application in Programming:

Bitwise operations are commonly used in low-level programming, such as system-level programming, embedded systems, and optimization of certain algorithms. Here are a few examples of their applications:

1. **Flag Manipulation:** Using individual bits as flags to represent various states or options efficiently.

2. **Bitmasking:** Combining bitwise AND, OR, XOR operations to create or extract specific bit patterns within a larger set of bits.

3. **Optimizations:** Some algorithms can be optimized using bitwise operations to achieve better performance or reduce memory usage.

4. **Hardware Interaction:** In embedded systems or device drivers, bitwise operations are often used to interact with hardware registers where each bit has a specific meaning.

5. **Cryptography:** In some cryptographic algorithms, bitwise operations are used for manipulation of keys and data.

While bitwise operations can be powerful, they are low-level and might not be as commonly used in high-level programming as in low-level programming. In TypeScript and similar high-level languages, you may encounter bitwise operations when dealing with certain algorithms, optimizations, or specific use cases.
