Tower of Hanoi Algorithm:

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of discs from one pole to another, using a temporary pole, following specific rules.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the number of discs.

What It Does: Given a number of discs and three poles (source, auxiliary, and target), the Tower of Hanoi algorithm calculates the steps needed to move the stack of discs from the source pole to the target pole, following specific rules.

Heres an example of implementing the Tower of Hanoi algorithm in JavaScript:

function towerOfHanoi(n, source, auxiliary, target) {
  if (n === 1) {
    console.log(`Move disc 1 from ${source} to ${target}`);
    return;
  }

  towerOfHanoi(n - 1, source, target, auxiliary);
  console.log(`Move disc ${n} from ${source} to ${target}`);
  towerOfHanoi(n - 1, auxiliary, source, target);
}

towerOfHanoi(3, 'A', 'B', 'C');
/* Output:
Move disc 1 from A to C
Move disc 2 from A to B
Move disc 1 from C to B
Move disc 3 from A to C
Move disc 1 from B to A
Move disc 2 from B to C
Move disc 1 from A to C
*/
The Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved using recursion and follows a specific pattern of moves based on the number of discs. The time complexity grows exponentially with the number of discs. To make it more effective, use memoization or dynamic programming techniques if applicable.

Tower of Hanoi Algorithm

  
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem of recursion. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The solution to this problem can be achieved through a recursive algorithm. Here is a simple implementation of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm in JavaScript:

function TowerOfHanoi(n, from_rod, to_rod, aux_rod) {
    if (n == 1) {
        console.log("Move disk 1 from rod " +  from_rod + " to rod " + to_rod);
        return;
    }
    TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, from_rod, aux_rod, to_rod);
    console.log("Move disk " + n + " from rod " +  from_rod + " to rod " + to_rod);
    TowerOfHanoi(n - 1, aux_rod, to_rod, from_rod);
}

let n = 4; // Number of disks
TowerOfHanoi(n, 'A', 'C', 'B');  // Names of rods
newline.co

In this code:

The TowerOfHanoi function recursively moves n-1 disks from the from_rod to the aux_rod, moves the nth disk from the from_rod to the to_rod, and then moves the n-1 disks from the aux_rod to the to_rod.
The time complexity of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the number of disks. This is because for each disk, we make two recursive calls to the TowerOfHanoi function.
