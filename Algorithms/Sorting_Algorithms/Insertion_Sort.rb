Insertion Sort Algorithm:

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly moving elements to their correct positions in the sorted part of the array.

Heres the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript:

function insertionSort(arr) {
  const n = arr.length;

  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    const key = arr[i];
    let j = i - 1;

    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }

    arr[j + 1] = key;
  }

  return arr;
}

const arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
console.log(insertionSort(arr)); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

    
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases. In the best-case scenario, when the array is already sorted, the time complexity is O(n). However, in general, Insertion Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets compared to more advanced algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.




  
Effective Implementation:

To make the Insertion Sort algorithm more effective:

Use Binary Search: When finding the correct position for inserting elements, use binary search to reduce the number of comparisons and improve the overall efficiency.

Small Subarray Size: For small subarrays, insertion sort can be faster than more advanced algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort. Therefore, consider using Insertion Sort for smaller subarrays and switch to a more efficient algorithm for larger subarrays.

Early Termination: If the array is already sorted or partially sorted, Insertion Sort can take advantage of this fact and terminate the sorting process early. Implementing checks for these cases can improve efficiency.

While Insertion Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, it can be useful for sorting small arrays or partially sorted arrays. Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the desired efficiency for the given use case.

    Lets go step-by-step to understand how the Insertion sort algorithm works:

function insertionSort(arr) {
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let current = arr[i];
        let j = i - 1;
        while ((j > -1) && (current < arr[j])) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = current;
    }
    return arr;
}

let arr = [5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 4, 2, 42, 4, 5, -8, 5, 7, 4, -76, 6, 4, 5, -74];
console.log(insertionSort(arr));
Explanation:

The insertionSort function takes an array arr as the input.
It starts from the second element of the array (at index 1). This is because it considers the first element as the sorted part of the array.
For each element, it saves the current element in a variable current and also keeps track of the last element in the sorted portion with j.
Then, it enters a while loop that continues until it finds the correct position for the current element in the sorted part of the array. This position is found when it encounters an element smaller than current or when it has checked all elements in the sorted part.
In the while loop, it shifts elements of the sorted portion that are larger than current to one position ahead of their current position, creating room for the current element.
Once it has found the position, it inserts the current element there.
It repeats this process for the entire array until its fully sorted.
Time Complexity:

The worst-case time complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(n^2) when the array is reverse sorted. On the other hand, the best-case time complexity can be O(n) when the array is already sorted.

Optimization:

The Insertion Sort isnt generally efficient for large datasets due to its quadratic worst-case time complexity. It shines more with small datasets, or when the input is nearly sorted. However, certain hybrid algorithms like Timsort and Introsort take advantage of Insertion Sorts efficiency in sorting small arrays. These algorithms begin with algorithms (like Merge Sort, Heap Sort) good for large datasets but switch to Insertion Sort when the data subset is small, effectively optimizing the sort operation.

Remember though, before making any decision on which sorting algorithm to use, you should consider the properties of your data and whats most important for your use case â€“ speed, memory usage, stability (preserving relative order of equal elements), etc.

I hope this was helpful and you have a better understanding of the Insertion Sort algorithm!
