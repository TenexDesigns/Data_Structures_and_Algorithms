Merge Sort Algorithm:

Merge Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer approach. It divides the unsorted array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

Heres the implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in JavaScript:

function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  return merge(left, right);
}

function merge(left, right) {
  const result = [];
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;

  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex]);
      leftIndex++;
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex]);
      rightIndex++;
    }
  }

  return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

const arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
console.log(mergeSort(arr)); // Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of Merge Sort is always O(n log n) in all scenarios. It consistently divides the array into two halves and performs merging in linear time. The merge operation takes O(n) time in total, where n is the total number of elements in the array.

Effective Implementation:

To make Merge Sort more effective:

Use Insertion Sort for Small Subarrays: For small subarrays, using a simpler sorting algorithm like Insertion Sort can be more efficient than recursively applying Merge Sort. Implement a cutoff for small subarrays and use Insertion Sort for them.

Avoid Unnecessary Merging: During the merging step, check if the two halves are already sorted. If they are, there is no need to perform the merge operation, which can save unnecessary comparisons.

function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  if (left[left.length - 1] <= right[0]) {
    return left.concat(right);
  }

  return merge(left, right);
}
Merge Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that guarantees O(n log n) time complexity in all scenarios. Its divide and conquer approach allows for parallelization and makes it useful in various applications. While it may not be the most space-efficient algorithm due to the additional space required for merging, its stable sorting nature and consistent performance make it a popular choice for sorting tasks.

    The Merge Sort algorithm operates by splitting an array into halves, sorting those halves, and then merging them back together. This process is repeated recursively until the entire array is sorted. The algorithm falls under the "divide-and-conquer" category and is a stable sort, which means that equal elements maintain their original order.

Here is a JavaScript implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm:

function merge(left, right){
    let resultArray = [], leftIndex = 0, rightIndex = 0;

    // Concatenation of values into the resultArray in order
    while(leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length){
        if(left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]){
            resultArray.push(left[leftIndex]);
            leftIndex++; // move left array cursor
        } else {
            resultArray.push(right[rightIndex]);
            rightIndex++; // move right array cursor
        }
    }

    // Concatenate remaining elements from either left OR the right
    return resultArray.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}

function mergeSort(unsortedArray){
    // If the array only has one element or is empty, return it because its already sorted
    if(unsortedArray.length <= 1){
        return unsortedArray;
    }
    // Finding the middle element to divide the array into halves
    const middle = Math.floor(unsortedArray.length / 2);

    // Dividing the array into left and right
    const left = unsortedArray.slice(0, middle);
    const right = unsortedArray.slice(middle);

    // Using recursion to combine the left and right
    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

let myArray = [3, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 8];
console.log(mergeSort(myArray)); // Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
In this JavaScript code, mergeSort function splits the given unsortedArray into two halves recursively until they contain either one or zero elements. The 'merge' function then merges pair of sorted arrays. It loops over the arrays, and adds the smaller element from either the front of 'left' or 'right' array to the 'resultArray'. After one of the arrays has been fully iterated over, the remaining elements from the other array are appended to 'resultArray'.

The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all cases (best, typical and worst). Reason behind such efficiency is the array always split into two halves, providing a balanced recursion tree, regardless of the order in which elements are present in the original array.

The Merge Sort algorithm requires additional space, hence has a space complexity of O(n) as it needs a temporary array of the same size as that of input. This differentiates it from some in-place sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, which does not require any additional space.

Where Merge Sort really comes to the fore is larger datasets. It excels even when data is present in slow-to-access areas like disk storage, thanks to its sequential access pattern. However, it may not be the first choice for smaller arrays or arrays that are nearly sorted, where simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort or Quick Sort could perform better.

Overall, Merge Sort is a reliable and efficient algorithm for sorting large amounts of data, whilst maintaining element order. Keyword to remember in optimization is - balance, it performs optimally when array is split into balanced halves.
