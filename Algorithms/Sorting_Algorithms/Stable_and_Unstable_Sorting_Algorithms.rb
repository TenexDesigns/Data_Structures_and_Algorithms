In the context of sorting algorithms, stability refers to the property of maintaining the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output as they appeared in the original input. If two elements have the same value in the input array and one comes before the other, a stable sorting algorithm will ensure that their relative positions remain the same after sorting.

On the other hand, an unstable sorting algorithm may not guarantee the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. When sorting with an unstable algorithm, the relative positions of equal elements might change after the sorting process.

Stable Sorting Algorithms:

Merge Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Tim Sort (a hybrid sorting algorithm based on merge sort and insertion sort, used in some programming languages built-in sort methods)



Unstable Sorting Algorithms:

Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Selection Sort

Its important to note that the stability of a sorting algorithm can be relevant in certain scenarios, such as when sorting records with multiple keys or when the original order of equal elements matters. Stable sorting algorithms are often preferred in such cases to ensure that the relative positions of equal elements are preserved after sorting. However, in many situations, the choice of a stable or unstable sorting algorithm may not significantly impact the outcome or performance of the sorting process.

Stability in sorting algorithms is an attribute that determines whether the relative order of equal elements is preserved after sorting.

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the input data set. In other words, a stable sorting algorithm maintains the position of two equals elements relative to one another. This attribute is mainly important when we have key-value pairs with duplicate keys possible (like peopleâ€™s names as keys and their details as values) geeksforgeeks.org, baeldung.com.

On the other hand, a sorting algorithm is unstable if it doesnt preserve the relative order of equal elements. That means, after sorting, the relative order of equal elements can change.

Here are some examples of stable and unstable sorting algorithms:

Stable sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Counting Sort are examples of stable sorting algorithms. These algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys.
Unstable sorting algorithms: Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort are examples of unstable sorting algorithms. These algorithms may change the relative order of records with equal keys programiz.com.
In situations where the stability of a sorting algorithm is crucial, its recommended to use stable sorting algorithms. However, if stability is not a concern, unstable sorting algorithms can be used as they often have other advantages, such as being more efficient in terms of time or space complexity.
