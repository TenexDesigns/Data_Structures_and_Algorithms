Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to rearrange a list of items in a particular order, typically numerical or lexicographical order. The efficiency of a sorting algorithm is defined by its time complexity. Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms in JavaScript:

1.Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

Heres an example of bubble sort in JavaScript:

   function bubbleSort(arr) {
       let len = arr.length;
       for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
           for (let j = 0; j < len - i - 1; j++) {
               if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                   let temp = arr[j];
                   arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                   arr[j + 1] = temp;
               }
           }
       }
       return arr;
   }

   let arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
   bubbleSort(arr);
   console.log("Sorted array: " + arr);

2.Selection Sort
         
Selection sort is another comparison-based algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The time complexity of the selection sort algorithm is O(n^2) in all cases.

Heres an example of selection sort in JavaScript:

   function selectionSort(arr) {
       let len = arr.length;
       for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
           let min = i;
           for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
               if (arr[min] > arr[j]) {
                   min = j;
               }
           }
           if (min != i) {
               let tmp = arr[i];
               arr[i] = arr[min];
               arr[min] = tmp;
           }
       }
       return arr;
   }

   let arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11];
   selectionSort(arr);
   console.log("Sorted array: " + arr);

3.Merge Sort
             
Merge sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm that works on the divide and conquer principle. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(n log n) in all cases.

Heres an example of merge sort in JavaScript:

   function mergeSort (arr) {
       if (arr.length < 2) return arr;
       let mid = Math.floor(arr.length /2);
       let subLeft = mergeSort(arr.slice(0,mid));
       let subRight = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
       return merge(subLeft, subRight);
   }

   function merge (node1, node2) {
       let result = [];
       while (node1.length > 0 && node2.length > 0)
           result.push(node1[0] < node2[0]? node1.shift() : node2.shift());
       return result.concat(node1.length? node1 : node2);
   }

   let arr = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62];
   console.log(mergeSort(arr));

To optimize sorting algorithms:

Use an algorithm that matches the nature of your data. For example, if you know your data is nearly sorted, bubble sort could be a good choice because it has a best-case time complexity of O(n).
Avoid using inefficient algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort for large datasets. Instead, use more efficient algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, or heapsort.
Take advantage of JavaScripts built-in sort() method for small datasets or when performance is not a concern. This method uses a stable sorting algorithm (merge sort or insertion sort depending on the engine).
If stability is a concern (i.e., you want to preserve the original order of equal elements), avoid using quicksort as its not a stable sorting algorithm.
If memory usage is a concern, avoid using merge sort as its not an in-place sorting algorithm and requires additional space to store the sublists [educba.com](https://www.educba
