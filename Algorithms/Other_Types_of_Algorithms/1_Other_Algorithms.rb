  A* Search Algorithm:

A* (A-star) is a pathfinding algorithm often used in graph-based applications like maps and games. It finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node in a weighted graph.

  
  
Boyer-Moore String Searching Algorithm:

The Boyer-Moore algorithm is an efficient string searching algorithm that performs pattern matching by scanning the text from right to left, leveraging preprocessing of the pattern to skip unnecessary comparisons.

  
  
Miller-Rabin Primality Test:

The Miller-Rabin primality test is a probabilistic algorithm used to determine if a number is likely to be prime or composite.

  
  
Fisher-Yates Shuffle:

The Fisher-Yates shuffle (also known as Knuth shuffle) is an algorithm used to randomly shuffle an array or list in-place.

  
  

RSA Algorithm:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that involves encryption and decryption using a pair of public and private keys.

  
  
Bloom Filter:

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set or not. It offers constant-time membership queries with a trade-off for false positives.

    
    
  Rabin-Karp Fingerprinting Algorithm:

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string searching algorithm that uses hashing to find occurrences of a pattern in a text.

    
    
  Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):

BCNF is a database normalization algorithm used to eliminate data redundancy and improve database efficiency.

    
    Viterbi Algorithm:

The Viterbi algorithm is used in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states given a sequence of observations.
