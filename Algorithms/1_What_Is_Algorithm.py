Big O notation

Types of Algorthims
 - Math algorithms
 - Sort algoritms
 - Search algorithms
 - Misc . algorthims and problem solving algortims



1. WHat is an algorithm
- An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem

input --> Algoritm --> Output

e.g Algoritm to add two numbers

input a,b   algorthm       output
            add a +b       addition of a and b
            return sum



CHARACTERISTIC OF ALGORITMS

- Have well defined inputs and outputs
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous
- Language independed



Why Leran Algorthms

As a developer , you are going to come across problems that you need to solve

Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficently solve these problems

One problem can be solved in many ways using different algoritms

 Every algoritmn comes with its owm tradeoffs when it comes to performnce 

There are multiple ways to solve one problem

e.g There are multiple algorithms to sort a list of numbers

How do we analize which one of them is the most efficent algoritm


HOW DO WE MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ALGORITM

Algortim analis

The absolute running time of an algoritm can  not be predicted , since it depends on a number of factors

- Progrming language used to implement the algoritm

- The computer the program runns on

-Other programs running at the same time

- Quality of the operating system





PERFORMACE

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input sixe.
   An what the imput size does to the algoetim in terms of  time complexity and space complexity

Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algoritm to run, as a function of input size
Space complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algoritm to run, as a function of input size



By eveluateing performance of an algortm against the input size, the analis is not only machine independet , but the comparison is also more approprite

Remeber , ther is no one solution that works every single time. It is always good to know multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints.


  If your app need to be very quick and has plenty of memeory to work with, you dont have to worry about spac complexity

If you have very little memeory to work with, you should pick a soulution that is reltively slower but need less space














HOW DO WE REPRENT THE TIME AND SPCE COLPLEXITY OF AN ALGORTHM
We  represnt space and time complexity of an algorithm using ASMPTONIC OTATIONS

ASYMPTONIC NOTATIONS - These are mathematical tools to represnent time and space complexity.

ASYMPTIONC NOTATIONS ARE OF THREE TYPES
-Big - O notation (O-notation) - WOrst case complexity
-Omega Noation (^-Notataion) - Best case complexity
-Theta noataion (o-Noatation) - Average case complexity


We wil prialy focus on Big-O complexity or worst case complexity since that i what is mmostly asked
