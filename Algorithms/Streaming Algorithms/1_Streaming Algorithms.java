Streaming algorithms are algorithms that process data in a single pass, using a limited amount of memory. They are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that don't fit into memory. TypeScript, being a superset of JavaScript, allows you to implement streaming algorithms similar to JavaScript.

Here's an example of a simple streaming algorithm for calculating the mean of a stream of numbers:

```typescript
class StreamingMean {
  private sum: number = 0;
  private count: number = 0;

  addNumber(num: number): void {
    this.sum += num;
    this.count++;
  }

  getMean(): number | null {
    if (this.count === 0) {
      return null;
    }
    return this.sum / this.count;
  }
}

// Example usage
const streamingMean = new StreamingMean();

// Simulate a stream of numbers
const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];

for (const num of numbers) {
  streamingMean.addNumber(num);
  const mean = streamingMean.getMean();
  console.log(`Current mean: ${mean}`);
}
```

In this example, the `StreamingMean` class maintains a running sum and count of numbers added to it. The `addNumber` method adds a number to the stream, and the `getMean` method returns the current mean.

This is a simple example, and streaming algorithms can be much more complex depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve. Popular algorithms in streaming include approximate counting, quantiles estimation, and frequent item counting.

Remember that TypeScript, being a statically typed language, can provide additional benefits in terms of code safety and maintainability, especially as your streaming algorithms become more complex.

  Streaming algorithms are a type of algorithm that process data as it arrives, rather than waiting for all the data to be available. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the data is too large to fit into memory, or when the data is arriving in real-time.

In TypeScript, you can implement a streaming algorithm using the built-in `Iterable` interface and the `for...of` loop. Here's a simple example of a streaming algorithm that calculates the sum of a stream of numbers:

```typescript
class SumStream {
 private sum = 0;

 constructor(private iterable: Iterable<number>) {}

 process() {
   for (let num of this.iterable) {
     this.sum += num;
   }
 }

 getSum() {
   return this.sum;
 }
}

// Usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sumStream = new SumStream(numbers);
sumStream.process();
console.log(sumStream.getSum()); // Output: 15
```

In this example, the `SumStream` class takes an `Iterable<number>` as input. The `process` method processes each number in the iterable, adding it to the sum. The `getSum` method returns the current sum.

This is a very basic example, but you can extend this concept to implement more complex streaming algorithms. For example, you could implement a streaming algorithm that calculates the average of a stream of numbers, or a streaming algorithm that filters out numbers that are less than a certain value [Source 9](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/iterators-and-generators.html).
