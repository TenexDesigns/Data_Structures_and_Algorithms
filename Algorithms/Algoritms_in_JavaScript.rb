Great! Let's continue our exploration of this topic by examining the types of algorithms and taking a closer look at some specific algorithm types including search, sort, recursion, and dynamic programming.

Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are used to retrieve information from data structures. Examples include Linear Search and Binary Search.

Linear Search
In a linear search, we look at every element in the data structure to find the one we're searching for.

function linearSearch(array, target) {
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
        if(array[i] === target){
            return i;    // return the index where the target is found
        }
    }
    return -1; // target not found
}
The time complexity of linear search is O(n) because, in the worst-case scenario, we need to look at every element in the data structure .

Binary Search
In a binary search, the data structure must be sorted. We start in the middle, if the target is lower than the middle element, we search the left half; if the target is larger, we search the right half. We repeat this until we either find the target or the search range is empty.

function binarySearch(array, target){
    let left = 0;
    let right = array.length - 1;
    while(left <= right){
        let middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if(array[middle] === target){
            return middle;
        } 
        else if(array[middle] < target){
            left = middle + 1;
        } 
        else{
            right = middle - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
The time complexity of binary search is O(logn) because, with each comparison, we eliminate half of the remaining elements from the search .

Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a certain order. Examples include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort.

Bubble Sort
Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.

function bubbleSort(array) {
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length - 1; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < array.length - 1 - i; j++){
            if(array[j] > array[j + 1]){
                let temp = array[j];
                array[j] = array[j + 1];
                array[j + 1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
    return array;
}
The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) because, in the worst-case scenario, we need to make n passes through the array, and each pass requires up to n comparisons .

Merge Sort
Merge sort works by dividing the array in half, sorting each half, and then merging them back together.

function mergeSort(array) {
    if(array.length < 2){
        return array;
    }
    let middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
    let left = array.slice(0, middle);
    let right = array.slice(middle);
    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

function merge(left, right) {
    let array = [];
    while(left.length && right.length){
        if(left[0] < right[0]){
            array.push(left.shift());
        } else{
            array.push(right.shift());
        }
    }
    return array.concat(left.slice()).concat(right.slice());
}
The time complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn) because, with each split, we divide the array in half, and then we need to make n comparisons to merge them back together .

Recursion
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself. A common application of recursion is in solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, identical problems.

Factorial
Here's how you might implement the factorial function using recursion:

function factorial(n){
   if(n === 0 || n === 1){
      return 1;
   } else {
      return n * factorial(n - 1);
   }
}
The time and space complexity of this function is O(n) because we make n recursive calls .

Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to each subproblem so that each one is solved only once.

Fibonacci
Here's how you might implement the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming:

function fibonacci(n, memo = {}){
    if(n in memo) return memo[n];
    if(n <= 2) return 1;
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
    return memo[n];
}
The time complexity of this function is O(n) because we use memoization to avoid redundant computation .

By understanding and practicing with these popular algorithms, you will develop a strong foundation for tackling algorithmic problems in your programming and data structure studies. Be sure to identify the best solution for a problem based on the time and space complexity requirements to write efficient and optimized code.
