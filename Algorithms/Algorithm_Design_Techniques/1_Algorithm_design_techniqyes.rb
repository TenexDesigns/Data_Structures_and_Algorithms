Algorithm Design Techniques are methods or approaches used to create efficient and effective algorithms to solve specific problems. Some of the common algorithm design techniques include:

Greedy Algorithms:
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution. These algorithms are often used for optimization problems. Examples of greedy algorithms include:

Kruskals algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.
Dijkstras algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.

  
Divide and Conquer:
Divide and Conquer is a strategy where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved independently, and then combined to get the final solution. This technique is widely used in sorting and searching algorithms. Examples include:

Merge Sort: It divides the array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges the sorted halves.
Quick Sort: It chooses a pivot, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.


  
Dynamic Programming:
Dynamic Programming is a method to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It stores the solutions of subproblems in a data structure and builds up to solve the original problem efficiently. Examples include:

Fibonacci sequence using memoization or tabulation to avoid redundant calculations.
Longest Common Subsequence problem.


  
Backtracking:
Backtracking is a method to solve problems incrementally by trying out different possibilities and undoing choices that do not lead to a valid solution. Examples include:

N-Queens problem: Placing N queens on an N x N chessboard without them attacking each other.
Sudoku puzzle solver.


  
Recursive Algorithms:
Recursive algorithms are algorithms that call themselves with smaller instances of the problem to be solved. Examples include:

Binary search on a sorted array.
Tower of Hanoi problem.
Permutations and Combinations.

  
Branch and Bound:
Branch and Bound is a method to solve optimization problems by systematically searching the solution space and using bounding techniques to eliminate suboptimal solutions. Examples include:

Traveling Salesman Problem.
Knapsack problem.

  
Randomized Algorithms:
Randomized algorithms introduce randomness in their computations to achieve a more efficient solution or to approximate a solution with high probability. Examples include:

Randomized Quick Sort: Choosing a random pivot in Quick Sort.
Las Vegas algorithm for finding the median of an array.
These are just some of the algorithm design techniques used to create efficient and effective algorithms. Depending on the problem at hand, a combination of these techniques or other specific approaches may be required to devise the most suitable algorithm.
