Algorithm design techniques are unique approaches or mathematical methods for creating algorithms and solving problems. Not all algorithms can solve a problem efficiently, so it's important to choose the right design technique based on the problem's nature. Here are some commonly used algorithm design techniques and examples of algorithms created using these techniques:

Greedy Algorithms: These algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each decision point with the hope that these local solutions will lead to a global optimum. An example is the activity selection problem, where the algorithm selects the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person or machine, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time collimator.ai.
Backtracking: This technique solves problems by trying out solutions and backtracking whenever it realizes that the current solution cannot be continued or should not be continued. A classic example of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle, which involves placing eight queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other collimator.ai.
Divide and Conquer: This method solves a problem by breaking it into smaller sub-problems until they become simple enough to solve directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. An example of this is the merge sort algorithm, which divides an unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element, then repeatedly merges sub-lists to produce sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining collimator.ai.
Brute Force: This technique involves searching all possible solutions to a problem and selecting the best one. For example, in the traveling salesman problem, a brute force algorithm would generate all permutations of the cities and calculate the cost of each tour, then select the tour with the lowest cost collimator.ai.
Recursive Algorithms: These algorithms solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler problems of the same type. An example is the calculation of factorial n (n!), which can be defined recursively as n * factorial(n-1) collimator.ai.
Dynamic Programming: This technique solves problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems, storing the results of certain calculations, and reusing those results in later calculations to reduce computation time. An example is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones collimator.ai.
Randomized Algorithms: These algorithms use a random number at least once during the computation to make decisions. An example is the QuickSort algorithm, which in its randomized version selects a random element as pivot to partition the array collimator.ai.
Remember, the choice of algorithm design technique depends on the specific problem youre trying to solve. Different techniques are suited to different types of problems, and the best technique for a given problem depends on the problem's characteristics and the computational resources available.
