Your logic is mostly correct, but there's a small mistake in the last line of the `prime` function. You should return `true` if none of the divisions inside the loop result in a remainder of 0. Here's the corrected version:

```typescript
function prime(n: number): boolean {
    if (n < 2) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (n % i === 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true; // Corrected to return true if no divisors are found
}

let ans = prime(5);
let ans2 = prime(15);

console.log(ans);  // Output: true (5 is a prime number)
console.log(ans2); // Output: false (15 is not a prime number)
```

Now, the function correctly returns `true` if the number is prime and `false` otherwise. Also, note that you could optimize the loop to run until the square root of `n` for efficiency, but the current implementation is still valid for small numbers.




  -------------------------------
  A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The simplest way to check if a number is prime is to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

Here is a simple function in TypeScript that checks if a number is prime:

```typescript
function isPrime(num: number): boolean {
   if (num <= 1) return false; // Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
   for(let i = 2; i < num; i++) {
       if(num % i === 0) return false; // If num is divisible by any number less than itself, it's not prime
   }
   return true; // If no divisors are found, num is prime
}
```

However, this function can be optimized. If a number is not prime, it will have a divisor less than or equal to its square root. This is because if `n` is not a prime, it can be factored into two factors `a` and `b`. If both `a` and `b` were greater than the square root of `n`, `a*b` would be greater than `n`, which is a contradiction. Therefore, we only need to check divisors up to the square root of `n`.

Here is the optimized function:

```typescript
function isPrime(num: number): boolean {
   if (num <= 1) return false; // Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
   if (num === 2) return true; // 2 is a prime number
   if (num % 2 === 0) return false; // If num is divisible by 2, it's not prime
   let sqrtNum = Math.sqrt(num);
   for(let i = 3; i <= sqrtNum; i += 2) { // Only check odd numbers
       if(num % i === 0) return false; // If num is divisible by any odd number less than its square root, it's not prime
   }
   return true; // If no divisors are found, num is prime
}
```

The time complexity of this function is O(sqrt(n)), and the space complexity is O(1). This is because the function only needs to check divisors up to the square root of the number, and does not need to store any additional data.
