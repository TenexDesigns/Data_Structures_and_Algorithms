Here are some resources that teach data structures and algorithms using pseudocode and a pseudocode-first approach:


* **Book:** *Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people* by Aditya Bhargava
* **Online resource:** *Coursera course: Algorithms* by Stanford University


**Tips for understanding the problems first and how to break them down into pseudocode:**


* **Identify the input and output of the problem.** What data do you need to solve the problem? What data do you need to return as output?
* **Break down the problem into smaller subproblems.** Once you have identified the input and output of the problem, try to break it down into smaller subproblems that are easier to solve.
* **Write pseudocode for each subproblem.** Once you have broken down the problem into smaller subproblems, write pseudocode for each subproblem. Pseudocode is a plain English description of the steps you need to take to solve the problem. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be clear and concise.
* **Put the pseudocode together.** Once you have written pseudocode for each subproblem, put it together into a complete solution.


**Do you need to know all the data structures offhead?**


No, you don't need to know all the data structures offhead. However, it is helpful to have a good understanding of the most common data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.


**Should you focus on problem-solving?**


Yes, you should focus on problem-solving. The best way to learn data structures and algorithms is by practicing by solving algorithmic problems. There are many websites that offer algorithmic problems to solve, such as LeetCode and HackerRank.


Here is a general approach to solving algorithmic problems with a pseudocode-first approach:


1. **Read and understand the problem.** Make sure you understand what the problem is asking you to do.
2. **Identify the input and output of the problem.** What data do you need to solve the problem? What data do you need to return as output?
3. **Come up with a solution.** This is where you will use your knowledge of data structures and algorithms to come up with a solution to the problem.
4. **Write pseudocode for your solution.** Pseudocode is a plain English description of the steps you need to take to solve the problem.
5. **Implement your solution in code.** Once you have written pseudocode for your solution, you can start implementing it in code.
6. **Test your solution.** Make sure to test your solution to make sure it works correctly.


If you are stuck on a problem, don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many online communities and forums where you can ask questions and get help from other programmers.


I hope this helps!
