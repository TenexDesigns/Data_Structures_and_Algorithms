Learning data structures and algorithms with a focus on problem-solving and pseudocode is a great approach, especially when you want to understand the underlying concepts before diving into a specific programming language. Here are some resources that emphasize a pseudocode-first approach:

### 1. **"Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein:**
   - While this classic textbook often provides code in various programming languages, it places a strong emphasis on explaining algorithms using pseudocode first. It's a comprehensive resource that covers a wide range of topics.

### 2. **"Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven S. Skiena:**
   - This book takes a practical approach to algorithm design and problem-solving. It emphasizes the importance of understanding problems before jumping into coding. It provides guidance on how to approach problems and develop algorithms.

### 3. **Coursera - "Algorithmic Toolbox" Specialization by the University of California, San Diego:**
   - This specialization offers a pseudocode-first approach to teaching algorithms. It covers a variety of topics and is beginner-friendly. The courses often provide pseudocode solutions to problems before transitioning to actual code.

### 4. **MIT OpenCourseWare - "Introduction to Algorithms" (6.006):**
   - MIT's "Introduction to Algorithms" course, available on OCW, often presents algorithms using pseudocode. It's a rigorous and comprehensive course that covers fundamental concepts.

### 5. **GeeksforGeeks:**
   - GeeksforGeeks provides pseudocode for a wide range of algorithms and data structures. The explanations are clear, and the platform offers practice problems to reinforce your understanding.

### 6. **LeetCode and HackerRank:**
   - While these platforms primarily focus on coding challenges, they often allow you to submit solutions using pseudocode. You can practice translating your pseudocode into actual code as you become more comfortable.

### 7. **Online Courses on edX and Udacity:**
   - Various online courses on platforms like edX and Udacity cover algorithms and data structures using a pseudocode-first approach. Look for courses that prioritize understanding and problem-solving.

### Approach to Learning:

1. **Focus on Problem Solving:**
   - Emphasize understanding the problem first. Break down the problem, identify the key requirements, and develop a high-level algorithmic solution using pseudocode.

2. **Iterate and Refine Pseudocode:**
   - Iterate on your pseudocode, making sure it captures the essence of your algorithm. Refine it before translating it into actual code.

3. **Understand Concepts Over Memorization:**
   - It's more important to understand the concepts behind data structures and algorithms rather than memorizing them. Focus on how and when to use a particular data structure or algorithm.

4. **Learn Gradually:**
   - Don't feel pressured to learn all data structures at once. Start with the basics, and gradually build your understanding. As you solve more problems, you'll naturally encounter and learn more data structures and algorithms.

5. **Practice Regularly:**
   - Regular practice is essential. Solve a variety of problems, and don't be afraid to revisit and refactor your pseudocode and code to improve your understanding.

Remember that the goal is to develop problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. As you become more comfortable with pseudocode, you'll find it easier to transition to actual code in your preferred programming language.
