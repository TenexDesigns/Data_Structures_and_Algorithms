The specific amount of math you need to know for developing efficient algorithms depends on the complexity of the algorithms you want to develop and the specific problems you want to solve. However, having a strong foundation in discrete math, algebra, and logarithms and exponents will be beneficial for most developers.

Here's a breakdown of how each subject can contribute to your algorithm development skills:

**Discrete Math:**

* **Problem-Solving Skills:** Discrete math provides a foundation for logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for algorithm design.

* **Set Theory:** Understanding sets, operations on sets, and functions is crucial for data structures and algorithms, particularly in areas like databases and search algorithms.

* **Graph Theory:** Graph theory is fundamental in understanding networks, routing algorithms, and social networks, all of which are relevant in modern software development.

**Algebra:**

* **Equation Solving:** Algebra provides the foundation for manipulating equations and expressions, a key skill in programming for solving problems and implementing algorithms.

* **Polynomial Functions:** Understanding polynomial functions and their properties is crucial for working with algorithms involving polynomials, such as polynomial interpolation and factorization.

* **Linear Algebra:** Linear algebra concepts like matrices, vectors, and eigenvalues are essential in computer graphics, machine learning, and optimization algorithms.

**Logarithms and Exponents:**

* **Logarithms and Exponents:** Logarithms and exponents are used in various computational tasks, such as calculating time complexities, optimizing algorithms, and handling large numbers.

By having a strong understanding of these subjects, you will be better equipped to:

* **Design efficient algorithms:** You will be able to analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithms and make informed decisions about how to improve their efficiency.

* **Solve complex problems:** You will be able to approach complex problems from a mathematical standpoint and break them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

* **Understand algorithm analysis:** You will be able to understand the formal notation used in algorithm analysis, such as Big O notation, and apply it to your own algorithms.

While you may not need to use all of these mathematical concepts on a daily basis, having a strong foundation in them will make you a more versatile and effective developer.
