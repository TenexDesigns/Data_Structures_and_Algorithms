Certainly! Below are the basic properties, methods, and performance characteristics for some of the data structures provided by Buckets-JS:

### Set:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Collection of unique elements.
- **Methods:**
  - `add(element)`: Adds an element to the set.
  - `contains(element)`: Checks if the set contains a specific element.
  - `remove(element)`: Removes an element from the set.
  - `union(set)`: Performs the union of two sets.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - Generally O(1) for add, remove, and contains operations.

### Dictionary:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Collection of key-value pairs.
- **Methods:**
  - `add(key, value)`: Adds a key-value pair to the dictionary.
  - `get(key)`: Retrieves the value associated with a key.
  - `remove(key)`: Removes a key-value pair from the dictionary.
  - `containsKey(key)`: Checks if a key exists in the dictionary.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - Generally O(1) for add, remove, and get operations.

### Heap:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Binary tree with parent-child relationships based on element values.
- **Methods:**
  - Operations for maintaining heap properties.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - O(log n) for insertion and extraction of the minimum/maximum element.

### Queue:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Collection with FIFO (First In, First Out) order.
- **Methods:**
  - `enqueue(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
  - `dequeue()`: Removes and returns the front element of the queue.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - O(1) for enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Stack:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Collection with LIFO (Last In, First Out) order.
- **Methods:**
  - `push(element)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - O(1) for push and pop operations.

### LinkedList:
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Linear collection of elements.
- **Methods:**
  - `add(element)`: Adds an element to the list.
  - `remove(element)`: Removes an element from the list.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - O(1) for add and remove operations.

### BSTree (Binary Search Tree):
- **Basic Properties:**
  - Tree structure with sorted elements.
- **Methods:**
  - `add(element)`: Adds an element to the tree.
  - `remove(element)`: Removes an element from the tree.
  - `contains(element)`: Checks if the tree contains a specific element.
- **Performance Characteristics:**
  - O(log n) for search, insertion, and deletion operations.

These are just summaries, and the actual performance may vary based on specific scenarios and usage patterns. It's recommended to refer to the library documentation for more detailed information.
