Top 5 datastrucres to lears


1.Heap
-max heap 
-min heap
-implement heaps using arrays and heapyfy
-when to use heap in questions - when you need quick access to max or min e.g use heaps to implememnt priority queue
- e.g of algorithms usning heap .e.g Heap sort, dijkstarts algorithm, median of stream algorithm


2.Binary Tree
-Root node, leaf node
-use cases - data base indexing, sorting algortihm, decision trees
- when to use binary tree in questions - ,when the questions instructs you to,
- Binary eees are greast candinates to use for recursion
-Learn tree transversal 
   e.g  -pre-order : 
        -post-order
        -in-order
        -Level -order
-Binary tree problems - Lowest common ancestor
                      - Print left view of a binary tree
                      - Binary tree maximum path sum







3.Hash map or Hash table 
- Takes in key and conerts it to index using hash function
- When to use it - When  you need to access information really quickly without using muc work
- Quick look ups in hash map come at the cost of extra space, so always thin if there are better solutions that do not us extra space
- top k problem



4. Stack and queueu and  Linked lists

-stack - pop
      - push

-queue - enqueue
      - dequeuu 

- STacks and queuues are impleented using arrays or Linked lists
- when to use it - When you have to access some previously seen values and you need to access the last seen value
-problems - Lagest rectangle in a histogram




5. Grapghs
- Used in many questions in coding interviews
-Vertices and edges
- directed and Undirected graph
- when to use - when you spot relationships between different entities in a  problem, use graph
-Learn about - Graph search
                    -Graph search algorithms
                        - Depth first search
                        - Brath first search
                        - Dijikstras algorithm
            - Topological sort
           - Loop in graph





















ALGORITHMS TO LERAN

6.Sliding window
7.Binary serach
8. Depth fiest serach and Breadth first search
8.Recursion - incliding trees, graphs, backtracking, dp ,and more, what it does, how it is used, it takes more memeory
9.Hash maps. used on two sum
10.Dynamic programin
11.System design
