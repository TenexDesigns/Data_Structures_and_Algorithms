The techniques you mentioned, like graph theory, removing characters already worked on recursive structures, parallelized computing, Knuth's Algorithm X, indexing words, arbitrary ordering, binary representations, can indeed be used to optimize code in TypeScript, Java, and Rust. However, how these techniques are applied can vary depending on the specific problem and the capabilities of the language.

Here are some examples of how these techniques can be used:

- **Graph Theory**: Graph theory can be used to model relationships between objects. For example, you can use graph algorithms to find the shortest path between two nodes, which can be useful in routing and navigation problems. In TypeScript, you can use libraries like [graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib) to work with graphs. In Java, you can use libraries like [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/). In Rust, you can use libraries like [petgraph](https://github.com/petgraph/petgraph).

- **Recursive Structures**: Recursive structures, like trees, are commonly used in programming. You can use recursion to traverse these structures. However, recursion can lead to a stack overflow error if the depth of recursion is too large. To avoid this, you can use techniques like tail recursion or iterative methods. All three languages (TypeScript, Java, Rust) support recursion.

- **Parallelized Computing**: Parallel computing can be used to speed up computation by performing multiple operations simultaneously. In TypeScript, you can use Web Workers for parallel computing. In Java, you can use threads and the [java.util.concurrent](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html) package. In Rust, you can use threads and the [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) crate for data parallelism.

- **Knuth's Algorithm X**: Knuth's Algorithm X is a recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm that finds all solutions to the exact cover problem. You can implement this algorithm in any of the three languages.

- **Indexing Words**: Indexing words can be used in text search algorithms to speed up search queries. For example, you can use a hash map to index words, where the keys are words and the values are the positions of the words in a text. All three languages (TypeScript, Java, Rust) support hash maps.

- **Arbitrary Ordering**: Arbitrary ordering can be used in algorithms that do not depend on the order of the input, like hash-based algorithms. All three languages (TypeScript, Java, Rust) support hash-based data structures.

- **Binary Representations**: Binary representations can be used in bitwise operations, compression algorithms, and other low-level programming tasks. All three languages (TypeScript, Java, Rust) support bitwise operations.

For the Jotto problem, which is a word guessing game, you might use techniques like indexing words and arbitrary ordering to optimize your solution. For example, you can index the words in a dictionary by their letter counts, so that you can quickly look up words that have a certain number of letters in common with the guessed word.

Remember that the effectiveness of these techniques can depend on the specific problem and the capabilities of the language. It's also important to consider the trade-offs between code readability, development time, and runtime efficiency when optimizing code.
