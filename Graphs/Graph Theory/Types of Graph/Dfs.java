Yes, the pseudocode you provided is a correct representation of a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. The `marked` array is used to keep track of visited vertices, and the algorithm recursively explores the neighbors of each vertex.

Here's the TypeScript implementation based on the provided pseudocode:

```typescript
class Graph {
  private vertices: number;
  private adjacencyList: Map<number, number[]>;

  constructor(vertices: number) {
    this.vertices = vertices;
    this.adjacencyList = new Map<number, number[]>();

    for (let i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
      this.addVertex(i);
    }
  }

  addVertex(vertex: number): void {
    this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
  }

  addEdge(source: number, destination: number): void {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(source) || !this.adjacencyList.has(destination)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid vertices');
    }

    this.adjacencyList.get(source)?.push(destination);
    this.adjacencyList.get(destination)?.push(source); // For undirected graph
  }

  dfs(startingVertex: number): void {
    const marked: boolean[] = new Array(this.vertices).fill(false);
    this.dfsRecursive(startingVertex, marked);
  }

  private dfsRecursive(vertex: number, marked: boolean[]): void {
    if (!marked[vertex]) {
      console.log(vertex);
      marked[vertex] = true;

      const neighbors = this.adjacencyList.get(vertex) || [];
      for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
        if (!marked[neighbor]) {
          this.dfsRecursive(neighbor, marked);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Example usage

const graph = new Graph(5);
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);

console.log('Depth-First Search (DFS):');
graph.dfs(0);
```

This TypeScript implementation follows the structure of the provided pseudocode and prints the vertices in the order they are visited during the DFS traversal. The time complexity of this DFS implementation is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
