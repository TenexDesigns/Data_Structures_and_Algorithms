Topological sorting is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. It essentially represents a valid sequence of tasks or events where each task depends on the completion of tasks that precede it.

### Topological Sorting in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Graph {
  private vertices: number;
  private adjacencyList: Map<number, number[]> = new Map();

  constructor(vertices: number) {
    this.vertices = vertices;
  }

  addEdge(source: number, destination: number): void {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(source)) {
      this.adjacencyList.set(source, []);
    }
    this.adjacencyList.get(source)!.push(destination);
  }

  topologicalSort(): number[] {
    const visited: boolean[] = Array(this.vertices).fill(false);
    const stack: number[] = [];

    const dfs = (vertex: number): void => {
      visited[vertex] = true;

      const neighbors = this.adjacencyList.get(vertex) || [];
      for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
          dfs(neighbor);
        }
      }

      stack.push(vertex);
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < this.vertices; i++) {
      if (!visited[i]) {
        dfs(i);
      }
    }

    return stack.reverse();
  }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new Graph(6);
graph.addEdge(5, 2);
graph.addEdge(5, 0);
graph.addEdge(4, 0);
graph.addEdge(4, 1);
graph.addEdge(2, 3);
graph.addEdge(3, 1);

const topologicalOrder = graph.topologicalSort();
console.log(topologicalOrder); // Output: [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0]
```

In this example, the `topologicalSort` method uses depth-first search (DFS) to perform topological sorting. The resulting array represents the order in which tasks or vertices can be executed or processed, respecting the dependencies in a directed acyclic graph.

### Use Cases:

1. **Task Scheduling:** Topological sorting is commonly used in project scheduling, where tasks depend on each other, and the order of execution is crucial.

2. **Build Systems:** In software development, when building a project with multiple modules, topological sorting helps determine the correct order to build modules based on their dependencies.

3. **Course Prerequisites:** In academic systems, topological sorting can be used to schedule courses, where some courses have prerequisites.

4. **Dependency Resolution:** Package managers use topological sorting to resolve dependencies and install packages in the correct order.

5. **Compiler Optimizations:** Compilers often use topological sorting to optimize code generation and minimize the number of registers required for variables.

Understanding the dependencies and relationships between tasks or entities in a directed acyclic graph allows for efficient scheduling and ordering, and topological sorting provides a solution to achieve this ordering.
