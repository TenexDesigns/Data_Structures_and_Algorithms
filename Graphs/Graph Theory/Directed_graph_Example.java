In TypeScript, you can represent directed graphs using either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list. Here's an example implementation using an adjacency list, which is a more space-efficient representation, especially for sparse graphs:

```typescript
class DirectedGraph {
  private vertices: number;
  private adjacencyList: Map<number, number[]>;

  constructor(vertices: number) {
    this.vertices = vertices;
    this.adjacencyList = new Map<number, number[]>();

    for (let i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
      this.addVertex(i);
    }
  }

  addVertex(vertex: number): void {
    this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, []);
  }

  addEdge(source: number, destination: number): void {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(source) || !this.adjacencyList.has(destination)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid vertices');
    }

    this.adjacencyList.get(source)?.push(destination);
  }

  printGraph(): void {
    for (const [vertex, neighbors] of this.adjacencyList.entries()) {
      const neighborsString = neighbors.join(', ');
      console.log(`${vertex} -> [${neighborsString}]`);
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new DirectedGraph(4);
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 0);
graph.addEdge(2, 3);
graph.addEdge(3, 3);

graph.printGraph();
```

In this example:

- The `DirectedGraph` class initializes with a specified number of vertices.
- The `addVertex` method adds a vertex to the graph.
- The `addEdge` method adds a directed edge from the source vertex to the destination vertex.
- The `printGraph` method prints the adjacency list, showing each vertex and its neighbors.

This representation is suitable for a sparse graph where the number of edges is much less than the maximum possible edges. If your graph is dense, an adjacency matrix might be a better choice.

Feel free to adapt this code according to your specific needs and the characteristics of the graphs you are working with.








  

is there a self loop and circle in the above grah
---------------------------

Apologies for any confusion in my previous responses. Let's clarify the graph representation and address your questions:

In the provided graph:

```plaintext
0 -> [1, 2]
1 -> [2]   
2 -> [0, 3]
3 -> [3]
```

- Vertex 3 has a self-loop because it has an edge pointing to itself (`3 -> [3]`).
- Vertices 0 and 2, along with the edges `(0, 2)` and `(2, 0)`, form a cycle.

### Terminology:

1. **Self-Loop:** An edge that connects a vertex to itself.

2. **Cycle:** A cycle in a graph is a set of vertices and edges that forms a closed loop.

### Graphs and Trees:

- **Graphs:** Trees are a special type of graph. In general, a graph consists of vertices and edges, and it can have various structures and properties. The provided directed graph is an example of a general graph.

- **Trees:** Trees are a specific type of acyclic graph with a hierarchical structure. They have a root, nodes (vertices), and edges that connect nodes. Trees have no cycles, and there is a unique path between any two nodes.

- **Binary Trees:** A type of tree where each node has at most two children (left and right).

- **AVL Trees:** A type of binary search tree that is balanced, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most one.

### Relationship between Trees and Graphs:

- Trees can be viewed as a specific type of graph (acyclic).
- Graphs can represent a broader category of structures that may include cycles and more complex relationships.

In summary, the provided directed graph has a self-loop and a cycle, and it is a general graph. Trees, binary trees, and AVL trees are special cases of graphs, each with specific properties and structures.
