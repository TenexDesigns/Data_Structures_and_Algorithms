Dynamic programming can be approached using different techniques, and the three main approaches are recursion, memoization, and bottom-up (also known as tabulation). Let's explore each approach, along with its implementation and the pros and cons:

### 1. Recursion:

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function fibonacciRecursive(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  return fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) + fibonacciRecursive(n - 2);
}
```

**Pros:**
- Conceptually simple and easy to understand.
- Mimics the natural way of solving problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

**Cons:**
- Can be inefficient for large inputs due to redundant computations.
- May lead to a deep call stack, causing a stack overflow for very large inputs.

### 2. Memoization:

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function fibonacciMemoization(n: number, memo: number[] = []): number {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }

  if (memo[n] !== undefined) {
    return memo[n];
  }

  memo[n] = fibonacciMemoization(n - 1, memo) + fibonacciMemoization(n - 2, memo);

  return memo[n];
}
```

**Pros:**
- Avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing previously computed results.
- Can significantly improve performance for recursive algorithms.

**Cons:**
- Requires additional space for the memoization table.
- May still suffer from stack overflow for extremely large inputs due to recursion.

### 3. Bottom-Up (Tabulation):

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function fibonacciTabulation(n: number): number {
  const table: number[] = [0, 1];

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2];
  }

  return table[n];
}
```

**Pros:**
- Avoids the call stack overhead associated with recursion.
- Often more memory-efficient than memoization.

**Cons:**
- May not be as intuitive as the recursive approach.
- Requires defining the order in which subproblems are solved, which may not be straightforward for all problems.

### Choosing the Right Approach:

- **Recursion vs. Memoization vs. Bottom-Up:**
  - Use recursion when the problem naturally breaks down into smaller subproblems.
  - Use memoization to optimize recursive solutions by avoiding redundant computations.
  - Use bottom-up when an iterative approach is more efficient and the order of subproblem solving is clear.

- **Considerations:**
  - Recursion is often a good starting point for understanding the problem.
  - Memoization is beneficial when recursion results in redundant computations.
  - Bottom-up is preferred for space efficiency and avoiding stack overflow.

The choice between these approaches depends on the specific problem, input size, and the trade-off between simplicity and efficiency.
