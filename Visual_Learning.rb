f youre looking for online learning platforms that offer visualization and animation-based learning for programming concepts, here are some options:

VisuAlgo: VisuAlgo is an online platform for learning data structures and algorithms through visualization. It allows users to see the step-by-step execution of algorithms and data structures, which can help in understanding how they work log2base2.com.
Algorithm Visualizer: Algorithm Visualizer is a web application that allows you to visualize various algorithms and data structures. It provides an interactive interface where you can control the speed of the visualizations and see the code that makes them work log2base2.com.
Data Structure Visualizations (University of San Francisco): This site provides a number of high-quality animations for various data structures and algorithms. Each of the animations is accompanied by detailed explanations and pseudo-code log2base2.com.
Algomation: Algomation is a platform where you can find, edit, and create new visualizations of algorithms. It allows users to share their visualizations with others, and all visualizations are open for anyone to view and learn from log2base2.com.
Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers a course called "Information Theory" which includes some animations and visualizations to explain concepts related to algorithms and data structures log2base2.com.
Coursera: Some courses on Coursera, like "Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization" by University of California San Diego, use visualizations and animations to explain the concepts log2base2.com.
Each of these platforms offer different types of visualizations and cater to different learning styles, so I recommend checking out a few to see which one suits you best.

































Top 5 datastrucres to lears


1.Heap
-max heap 
-min heap
-implement heaps using arrays and heapyfy
-when to use heap in questions - when you need quick access to max or min e.g use heaps to implememnt priority queue
- e.g of algorithms usning heap .e.g Heap sort, dijkstarts algorithm, median of stream algorithm


2.Binary Tree
-Root node, leaf node
-use cases - data base indexing, sorting algortihm, decision trees
- when to use binary tree in questions - ,when the questions instructs you to,
- Binary eees are greast candinates to use for recursion
-Learn tree transversal 
   e.g  -pre-order : 
        -post-order
        -in-order
        -Level -order
-Binary tree problems - Lowest common ancestor
                      - Print left view of a binary tree
                      - Binary tree maximum path sum







3.Hash map or Hash table 
- Takes in key and conerts it to index using hash function
- When to use it - When  you need to access information really quickly without using muc work
- Quick look ups in hash map come at the cost of extra space, so always thin if there are better solutions that do not us extra space
- top k problem



4. Stack and queueu and  Linked lists

-stack - pop
      - push

-queue - enqueue
      - dequeuu 

- STacks and queuues are impleented using arrays or Linked lists
- when to use it - When you have to access some previously seen values and you need to access the last seen value
-problems - Lagest rectangle in a histogram




5. Grapghs
- Used in many questions in coding interviews
-Vertices and edges
- directed and Undirected graph
- when to use - when you spot relationships between different entities in a  problem, use graph
-Learn about - Graph search
                    -Graph search algorithms
                        - Depth first search
                        - Brath first search
                        - Dijikstras algorithm
            - Topological sort
           - Loop in graph





















ALGORITHMS TO LERAN

6.Sliding window
7.Binary serach
8. Depth fiest serach and Breadth first search
8.Recursion - incliding trees, graphs, backtracking, dp ,and more, what it does, how it is used, it takes more memeory
9.Hash maps. used on two sum
10.Dynamic programin
11.System design
