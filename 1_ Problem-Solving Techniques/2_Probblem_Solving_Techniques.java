In addition to the problem-solving techniques you mentioned (dynamic programming, greedy method, branch and bound, recursion, iterative, divide and conquer), there are other techniques like the following:

1. **Backtracking**: This is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree).

2. **Brute Force**: This is a simple, brute-force algorithm that tries all possible solutions to find the optimal or the best solution. It is often used when the problem size is small.

3. **Memoization**: This is a technique used to speed up programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

4. **Tabulation**: This is a variant of dynamic programming where the table is filled in a bottom-up manner.

5. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

6. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: This is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Now, let's see examples of these techniques in TypeScript:

**Backtracking**:

```typescript
function permute(nums: number[]): number[][] {
   const result: number[][] = [];
   const path: number[] = [];
   backtrack(nums, path, result);
   return result;
}

function backtrack(nums: number[], path: number[], result: number[][]): void {
   if (path.length === nums.length) {
       result.push([...path]);
       return;
   }
   for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       if (path.includes(nums[i])) continue;
       path.push(nums[i]);
       backtrack(nums, path, result);
       path.pop();
   }
}
```

**Brute Force**:

```typescript
function maxSubArray(nums: number[]): number {
   let maxSum = -Infinity;
   for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
       let sum = 0;
       for (let j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
           sum += nums[j];
           maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
       }
   }
   return maxSum;
}
```

**Memoization**:

```typescript
function fib(n: number, memo: {[key: number]: number} = {}): number {
   if (n <= 1) return n;
   if (n in memo) return memo[n];
   memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo);
   return memo[n];
}
```

**Tabulation**:

```typescript
function fib(n: number): number {
   const dp = [0, 1];
   for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
       dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
   }
   return dp[n];
}
```

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:

```typescript
function bfs(graph: number[][], start: number): number[] {
   const visited = new Array(graph.length).fill(false);
   const queue: number[] = [start];
   visited[start] = true;
   while (queue.length > 0) {
       const node = queue.shift();
       console.log(node);
       for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
           if (!visited[neighbor]) {
               queue.push(neighbor);
               visited[neighbor] = true;
           }
       }
   }
   return visited;
}
```

**Depth-First Search (DFS)**:

```typescript
function dfs(graph: number[][], start: number): number[] {
   const visited = new Array(graph.length).fill(false);
   const stack: number[] = [start];
   visited[start] = true;
   while (stack.length > 0) {
       const node = stack.pop();
       console.log(node);
       for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
           if (!visited[neighbor]) {
               stack.push(neighbor);
               visited[neighbor] = true;
           }
       }
   }
   return visited;
}
```

These techniques can be used in various situations depending on the problem. For example, backtracking is useful for problems like the N-Queens problem, where you need to find all possible arrangements of N queens on an NxN chess board such that no two queens threaten each other. Brute force is suitable for problems where the
