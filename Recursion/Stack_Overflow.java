In programming, the call stack, which is used for function calls including recursion, is indeed finite. The maximum number of recursive calls that can be made is determined by the size of the stack, which is allocated by the operating system and varies between systems and configurations.

When a function is called, a new frame is added to the stack. Each frame contains the function's parameters and local variables. When the function returns, its frame is removed from the stack. If a function calls itself recursively too many times, the stack can become full, leading to a stack overflow error.

In JavaScript and TypeScript, which are typically run in a browser or Node.js environment, the maximum stack size is typically in the thousands to tens of thousands of function calls, but this can vary depending on the specific environment and the amount of memory available. For example, in Node.js, the default stack size is approximately 1000 to 2000 calls, but it can be increased with the `--stack-size` option.

If you try to make 100,000 recursive calls in a typical JavaScript or TypeScript environment, you will likely encounter a stack overflow error before all the calls are made. To handle such a large number of recursive calls, you would need to use an iterative approach or tail recursion, which is a form of recursion that can be optimized by the compiler to use constant stack space. However, note that JavaScript and TypeScript do not currently optimize for tail recursion.

In other languages, the maximum stack size can be different. For example, in Python, the default maximum recursion depth is 1000, but it can be changed with the `sys.setrecursionlimit` function. In Java, the maximum stack size is determined by the `-Xss` option when the JVM is started, and it is typically in the range of thousands to tens of thousands of calls.

In general, while recursion can be a powerful tool, it's important to be aware of the limitations of the stack and to avoid deep recursion that could lead to a stack overflow error.



---------------------------
  Yes, the stack is finite in recursion, and the number of operations it can handle depends on the available memory and the language or environment being used. In general, the stack size is limited to prevent stack overflow errors, which occur when the stack becomes full and cannot accommodate any more function calls.

The exact number of recursive calls that can be executed before a stack overflow occurs depends on various factors, including:

* **The language or environment:** Different languages and environments have different default stack sizes. For instance, in C++, the default stack size is typically 8KB, while in Python, it's around 1MB.

* **The depth of recursion:** The deeper the recursion, the more stack space is consumed. Complex recursive algorithms that involve multiple nested function calls can quickly exhaust the stack, leading to stack overflow errors.

* **The size of the function frames:** Each function call creates a stack frame, which stores the function's local variables, return address, and other information. Larger function frames, especially those with large arrays or data structures, can consume more stack space and reduce the number of recursive calls possible.

In the case of the decreasing number of 100000, whether it will execute recursively 100000 times depends on the factors mentioned above. If the function call overhead is minimal and the available stack space is sufficient, it might be possible to execute 100000 recursive calls. However, if the function call overhead is significant or the available stack space is limited, a stack overflow error might occur before reaching 100000 recursive calls.

To prevent stack overflow errors and ensure the successful execution of recursive algorithms, it's important to consider the factors that affect stack usage and design algorithms that minimize unnecessary recursion. Tail recursion, a specific form of recursion where the last recursive call is the tail of the function, is often used to optimize recursion and reduce stack usage.
  

---------------------------
Yes, recursion uses the call stack, and the stack space is finite. The maximum number of recursive calls a program can handle depends on the maximum stack depth allowed by the programming language and the system running the program.

In languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, and many other programming languages, there is a limit to the number of recursive calls due to the maximum call stack size. When a function is called, a new frame is added to the call stack, and the stack space is used to store local variables and control flow information for that function call.

For very deep recursion (with a large number of recursive calls), you can run into a stack overflow error. The exact limit varies between languages and environments.

In practice, modern programming languages and environments have mechanisms to detect and handle stack overflow situations, such as throwing an exception. However, relying on very deep recursion can lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.

For your example of 100,000 recursive calls, it depends on the specific environment and language. In some environments, this may be within acceptable limits, while in others, it might lead to a stack overflow.

It's worth noting that many recursive algorithms can be converted to iterative (loop-based) approaches, which often have better performance and do not rely on the call stack. If you encounter stack overflow issues with deep recursion, consider optimizing your code or using an iterative approach where appropriate.
