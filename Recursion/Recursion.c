Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It's a powerful tool that can simplify certain algorithms and problem-solving approaches. Recursion is often used when a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are structurally identical to the larger problem.

**Where and When is Recursion Used:**
Recursion is commonly used in various programming scenarios, including:

1. **Mathematical Problems:** Problems involving sequences (like Fibonacci), factorials, and combinations often have recursive solutions.

2. **Tree and Graph Traversal:** Recursive algorithms are frequently used to traverse tree-like or graph-like data structures, such as binary trees, directories, or linked lists.

3. **Divide and Conquer:** Recursive approaches are applied to divide complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems and then combine their solutions.

4. **Backtracking:** When exploring multiple possible solutions, backtracking algorithms use recursion to backtrack and try different paths when a solution fails.

5. **Dynamic Programming:** Some dynamic programming problems can be elegantly solved using recursion and memoization.

**How Recursion is Used:**
A recursive function consists of two main parts: a base case and a recursive case. The base case defines when the recursion should stop and provides a direct solution for a simple instance of the problem. The recursive case breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems and calls the function itself to solve them.

Here's a classic example of a recursive function that calculates factorials:

```javascript
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1; // Base case
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

**Reasoning Behind Recursion:**
Recursion allows you to solve complex problems by reducing them to simpler subproblems, mirroring the structure of the problem itself. It's a natural way to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar components.

**Problems Solved Using Recursion:**
Several classic programming problems are often solved using recursion:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculating Fibonacci numbers using recursion demonstrates the concept of overlapping subproblems.

2. **Factorials:** Recursive factorial calculations showcase a straightforward application of recursion.

3. **Binary Tree Traversal:** Recursion is commonly used to traverse binary trees (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

4. **Maze Solving:** Recursion can be applied to solve mazes or navigate through grids.

5. **String Permutations:** Recursive solutions can generate all possible permutations of a string.

6. **Tower of Hanoi:** A classic puzzle involving recursion to solve the problem of moving disks between pegs.

7. **Backtracking Problems:** Many combinatorial optimization problems, like the N-Queens problem or Sudoku, can be solved using recursion and backtracking.

It's important to note that while recursion is a powerful technique, it might not always be the most efficient solution. In some cases, an iterative or more specialized approach might be preferable.
