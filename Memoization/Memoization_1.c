Memoization is a programming technique used to optimize functions by caching the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. It is particularly useful for recursive algorithms and functions with overlapping subproblems, helping to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.

In memoization, a data structure (often an object or a map) is used to store computed results for specific inputs. When a function is called with certain arguments, the function first checks whether the result for those arguments is already stored in the cache. If it is, the cached result is returned immediately. If not, the function performs the computation, stores the result in the cache, and then returns the result.

Here's an example of memoization in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) {
    return memo[n];
  }
  
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }
  
  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function calculates Fibonacci numbers using memoization. The `memo` object stores previously computed Fibonacci values, preventing redundant calculations for the same input.

Use cases of memoization in programming include:

1. **Fibonacci sequence:** Calculating Fibonacci numbers using recursion can be very inefficient due to overlapping subproblems. Memoization significantly improves the performance of such calculations.

2. **Factorials:** Calculating factorials recursively can benefit from memoization, especially for larger numbers.

3. **Combinatorial problems:** Many combinatorial problems involve calculating the number of ways to choose or arrange items. Memoization can be applied to such problems to improve efficiency.

4. **String manipulation:** Problems involving string manipulation, such as finding the longest common subsequence, can use memoization to avoid redundant subproblem calculations.

5. **Dynamic programming:** Memoization is a key technique in dynamic programming, which involves solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

6. **Optimization problems:** Many optimization problems involve exploring multiple paths. Memoization helps avoid recomputing the same solutions multiple times.

Remember that memoization is most effective when a function is repeatedly called with the same or similar inputs. It is not necessary for all functions and may not provide a significant performance improvement in every case. It's important to analyze the problem and consider whether memoization would be a beneficial optimization strategy.
