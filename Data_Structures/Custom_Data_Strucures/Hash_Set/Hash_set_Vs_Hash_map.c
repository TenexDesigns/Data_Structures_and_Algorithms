A hash set, hash map, and hash table are related concepts, but they serve slightly different purposes:

1. **Hash Set:**
A hash set is a data structure that stores a collection of unique elements, where each element is stored only once. It provides fast insertion, deletion, and membership check operations. A hash set is often implemented using a hash table internally, where the keys are the elements themselves, and the values are not relevant. Hash sets are useful when you want to maintain a collection of distinct values and quickly check for membership.

2. **Hash Map (Hash Table):**
A hash map (or hash table) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing you to associate a value with a unique key. Hash maps provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations based on the key. Each key in a hash map is associated with a value, and you can use the key to retrieve the corresponding value. Hash maps are commonly used for implementing associative arrays, dictionaries, or symbol tables.

In essence, a hash set is a specialized version of a hash map where you only care about the keys (the elements) and not their associated values. Both hash sets and hash maps use the concept of hashing to achieve fast average-case time complexity for common operations.

For example, in JavaScript:

- A hash set can be implemented using an object, where keys are the elements you want to store, and values are not relevant (e.g., `const mySet = { 'element1': true, 'element2': true, ... };`).

- A hash map can be implemented using an object or the built-in `Map` class, where keys are associated with specific values (e.g., `const myMap = new Map(); myMap.set('key1', 'value1'); myMap.set('key2', 'value2'); ...;`).

In summary, while hash sets, hash maps, and hash tables all use hashing techniques for efficient data storage and retrieval, they have different use cases and purposes.
