Queue


The queue data strucure is a sequential collection of elemnts that follows the principle of First In First Out

The first elemnt inserted into the queue is first elemnt to be removed




 Analogy -----> A queueu of people . Peoople eneter the queueu at one end  and then leave the queuue from the other end

Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behaviour rather than being a mathematical model


The Queueu data struture supports two main operations
Enquque - which adds an element  to  the  end of the collection
Dequeue - which removes an elemennt  from the head of collection
