Binary Search Tree in JavaScript
A Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a maximum of two children referred to as the left child and the right child. The node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent, and the node to the right of the parent node is always greater than the parent medium.com.

Below is a simple implementation of a BST in JavaScript:

class Node {
    constructor(data, left = null, right = null) {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

class BST {
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }
    // methods go here
}
In this implementation, each node has a data property and left and right pointers that point to the nodes left and right children. The BST class initializes with a root that is set to null medium.com.

Methods of BST in JavaScript
Common methods that can be implemented on a BST include:

Insert(data): This method inserts a new node into the BST. If the BST is empty, the new node becomes the root. If not, it compares the new node with the root and places it appropriately.
    insert(data) {
        const node = this.root;
        if (node === null) {
            this.root = new Node(data);
            return;
        } else {
            const searchTree = function(node) {
                if (data < node.data) {
                    if (node.left === null) {
                        node.left = new Node(data);
                        return;
                    } else if (node.left !== null) {
                        return searchTree(node.left);
                    }
                } else if (data > node.data) {
                    if (node.right === null) {
                        node.right = new Node(data);
                        return;
                    } else if (node.right !== null) {
                        return searchTree(node.right);
                    }
                } else {
                    return null;
                }
            };
            return searchTree(node);
        }
    }
   
Find(data): This method finds a node with the given data. It starts from the root and compares the data of each node with the given data. If the data is less than the node's data, it goes to the left child. If it's more, it goes to the right child.
    find(data) {
        let current = this.root;
        while (current.data !== data) {
            if (data < current.data) {
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                current = current.right;
            }
            if (current === null) {
                return null;
            }
        }
        return current;
    }
    
Remove(data): This method removes a node with the given data. Its a bit more complex due to the need to reassign children once the node is removed.
    remove(data) {
        // code for remove
    }
    
Additional methods can be created for pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal medium.com.

Time Complexity
The time complexity for operations in a BST can be as follows:

Search: O(log(n))
Insertion: O(log(n))
Deletion: O(log(n))
These time complexities are for a balanced BST. In the worst case (when the tree becomes skewed), the time complexity can become O(n) geeksforgeeks.org.

Array in JavaScript
An Array in JavaScript is a linear data structure that can hold multiple items of different data types. Its an object that stores elements of similar data type sequentially and maps each element to an integer key corresponding to its index geeksforgeeks.org.

Heres an example of an array in JavaScript:

let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
Common methods for arrays in JavaScript include:

push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.
unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the front of an array and returns the new length of the array.
slice(): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.
splice(): Changes the contents of an array by removing or
