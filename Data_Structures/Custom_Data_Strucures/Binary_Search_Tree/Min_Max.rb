Min    ---->  The method traverses the tree starting from the given node and keeps moving left until it reaches the leftmost leaf, which contains the minimum value.


min(root){
        if (!root.left) {
            return root.value
        } else {
           return this.min(root.left)
        }
    }



Max  ---->   The method traverses the tree starting from the given node and keeps moving right until it reaches the rightmost leaf, which contains the maximum value.
  
max(root){
        if(!root.right){
            return root.value
        }else{
            return this.max(root.right)
        }
    }


  
Explanation:

min method: The min method returns the minimum (smallest) value in the binary search tree. It takes a parameter node which represents the starting node for the search. If no node is provided, it defaults to the root of the tree. The method traverses the tree starting from the given node and keeps moving left until it reaches the leftmost leaf, which contains the minimum value.

max method: The max method returns the maximum (largest) value in the binary search tree. Similar to the min method, it takes a parameter node that represents the starting node for the search. If no node is provided, it defaults to the root of the tree. The method traverses the tree starting from the given node and keeps moving right until it reaches the rightmost leaf, which contains the maximum value.

In the example usage, the min method is called to find the smallest value in the binary search tree, and the max method is called to find the largest value. The output will be the minimum value (3) and the maximum value (22) in the tree, respectively.

Sure, heres the implementation of the min and max methods in the BinarSearchTree class and an explanation of how they work:

class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class BinarSearchTree {
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }

    // ... (other methods)

    min(node = this.root) {
        if (!node) {
            // Empty tree, return null
            return null;
        }

        // Traverse the left subtree to find the minimum value (smallest value is the leftmost leaf)
        while (node.left !== null) {
            node = node.left;
        }

        return node.value;
    }

    max(node = this.root) {
        if (!node) {
            // Empty tree, return null
            return null;
        }

        // Traverse the right subtree to find the maximum value (largest value is the rightmost leaf)
        while (node.right !== null) {
            node = node.right;
        }

        return node.value;
    }

    // ... (other methods)
}

// Example usage:
const bst = new BinarSearchTree();
bst.insert(10);
bst.insert(7);
bst.insert(15);
bst.insert(5);
bst.insert(9);
bst.insert(12);
bst.insert(20);
bst.insert(3);
bst.insert(8);
bst.insert(19);
bst.insert(22);

console.log("Minimum value:", bst.min());
console.log("Maximum value:", bst.max());

In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the minimum value is located at the farthest left node, and the maximum value is located at the farthest right node. This is because, by definition, every nodes left child is less than the node and every nodes right child is greater than the node.

Here is how you can implement methods to find the minimum and maximum values in a BST:

class BinarySearchTree {
    //...
    findMin() {
        let current = this.root;
        while (current.left !== null) {
            current = current.left;
        }
        return current.value;
    }

    findMax() {
        let current = this.root;
        while (current.right !== null) {
            current = current.right;
        }
        return current.value;
    }
    //...
}
In the findMin method, we start at the root of the BST and continue moving to the left child of the current node as long as its not null. The last node we reach (which has no left child) is the node with the minimum value.

Similarly, in the findMax method, we start at the root of the BST and continue moving to the right child of the current node as long as its not null. The last node we reach (which has no right child) is the node with the maximum value.

Both methods return the value of the node with the minimum or maximum value, respectively.

The time complexity of these methods is O(h), where h is the height of the BST, as in the worst case we need to traverse from the root to the deepest leaf node. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a single variable to keep track of the current node geeksforgeeks.org, geeksforgeeks.org.
