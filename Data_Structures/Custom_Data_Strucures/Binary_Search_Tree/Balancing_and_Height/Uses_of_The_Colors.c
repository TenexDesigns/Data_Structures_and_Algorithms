In a Red-Black Tree, the color of each node is either red or black. The coloring of nodes is not arbitrary; it follows specific conditions and rules to maintain the properties of the tree. The coloring of nodes is crucial to ensuring that the tree remains balanced and satisfies the Red-Black properties.

The conditions for coloring nodes in a Red-Black Tree are as follows:

1. **Root Node Color:**
   - The root node must always be black. This is a fundamental property of Red-Black Trees.

2. **Leaf Node Color:**
   - All leaf nodes (also known as NULL or sentinel nodes) are considered to be black. These nodes do not contain any actual data and are used to simplify tree traversal and property enforcement.

3. **Red Property:**
   - Red nodes cannot have red children. This property ensures that no two red nodes are adjacent along any path from the root to a leaf. In other words, if a node is red, both its children must be black (null nodes are considered black).

4. **Black Height Property:**
   - Every path from a node to its descendant leaf nodes must have the same number of black nodes. This property ensures that the tree remains approximately balanced in terms of height.

When performing insertions and rotations in a Red-Black Tree, the colors of nodes may change to maintain these properties while adjusting the tree's structure. The specific conditions and rules for color changes are as follows:

1. **Insertion:**
   - A newly inserted node is initially colored red.
   - If a red node's parent is also red, a violation of the Red Property occurs. In this case, color changes and rotations are performed to restore the property.
   - The goal of the color changes during insertion is to fix the violation while maintaining the Black Height Property.

2. **Deletion:**
   - When deleting a black node, the Black Height Property may be violated. To maintain the property, additional adjustments are made through rotations and color changes.
   - If a black node is replaced by a red node during deletion, the properties may still be satisfied.

Remember that these color rules and conditions ensure that Red-Black Trees remain balanced and maintain relatively short paths from the root to the leaves, resulting in efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.

In the JavaScript code sample provided earlier, you can see that the `Node` class has a `color` property that is either `'red'` or `'black'`, and the `RedBlackTree` class includes methods like `fixInsertion` and `fixDeletion` to handle color changes and adjustments after insertion and deletion operations.
