## Splay Trees

Splay Trees are a type of self-adjusting binary search trees. The main idea behind Splay Trees is to bring the recently accessed item to the root of the tree through a series of rotations, known as splaying. This makes Splay Trees particularly useful for applications where certain items are accessed more frequently [Source 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-splay-tree-data-structure/), [Source 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-in-splay-tree/).

Here is an example of a Splay Tree in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data, left = null, right = null) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

class SplayTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  // Splay operation
  splay(data) {
    // TODO: Implement splay operation
  }

  // Insert operation
  insert(data) {
    let node = new Node(data);
    if (!this.root) {
      this.root = node;
    } else {
      this.splay(data);
      /* Now the root contains the nearest node to the inserted node
         we just need to adjust the pointers and make the inserted node as root */
      if (this.root.data > data) {
        node.right = this.root;
        node.left = this.root.left;
        this.root.left = null;
        this.root = node;
      } else {
        node.left = this.root;
        node.right = this.root.right;
        this.root.right = null;
        this.root = node;
      }
    }
  }

  // TODO: Implement delete, find, and other operations
}
```

In the code above, a `Node` class is defined to represent each node in the Splay Tree. The `SplayTree` class then defines the methods for the splay and insert operations, and placeholders for delete, find, and other operations.

Splay Trees are used in various applications such as caches, memory allocators, data compression algorithms, and garbage collectors due to their property of moving frequently accessed elements closer to the root. However, they do not provide the same worst-case guarantee of balance as AVL or Red-Black trees [Source 4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-splay-tree-data-structure/), [Source 6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-in-splay-tree/).
