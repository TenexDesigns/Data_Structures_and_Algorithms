In a binary search tree (BST), which follows the property that for each node:

- All nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value.
- All nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.

The values on the left side of the root node must be less than the root nodes value, and the values on the right side must be greater.

So, no, in a standard binary search tree, a value on the left side of the root node cannot have a value greater than the root node. This would violate the fundamental property of a binary search tree, which ensures that values are correctly ordered to allow efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

No, in a binary search tree, a value on the left side of the root node cannot have a value greater than the root node. 

The fundamental property of a binary search tree is that the value of each node is greater than or equal to any values in its left sub-tree and less than or equal to any values in its right sub-tree. This property applies to every node in the tree, not just the root [Source 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/binary-search-trees-bst-explained-with-examples/), [Source 11](https://www.baeldung.com/java-binary-tree).

Here is an example of how a binary search tree maintains this property:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data, left = null, right = null) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  // Insert operation
  insert(data) {
    let node = new Node(data);
    if (!this.root) {
      this.root = node;
    } else {
      let current = this.root;
      while (true) {
        if (data < current.data) {
          if (!current.left) {
            current.left = node;
            break;
          }
          current = current.left;
        } else if (data > current.data) {
          if (!current.right) {
            current.right = node;
            break;
          }
          current = current.right;
        } else {
          break; // Ignore duplicates
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // TODO: Implement delete, find, and other operations
}
```

In the code above, the `insert` method ensures that for every node, all values in the left sub-tree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right sub-tree are greater than the node's value. This property is what makes binary search trees efficient for searching, as it allows the tree to eliminate half of the remaining nodes at each step of a search operation [Source 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/binary-search-trees-bst-explained-with-examples/).
