Building a complete file system like the one used in operating systems such as Windows is a complex task that goes beyond just implementing a directory tree data structure. Creating a full-fledged file system involves multiple layers of software and hardware interactions, including handling disk management, file metadata, file permissions, caching, and more.

Here are some high-level steps involved in building a file system:

1. **Disk Partitioning**: The first step is to partition the disk into logical sections that will serve as the storage for the file system.

2. **File System Layout**: Define the structure of the file system on the disk, including where metadata, directories, and files will be stored.

3. **Block Allocation**: Decide how to allocate storage space for files and directories on the disk. Various allocation methods, such as linked allocation, indexed allocation, or a combination of both, can be used.

4. **Metadata Management**: Define the metadata that needs to be associated with each file and directory, such as file size, permissions, creation/modification timestamps, etc.

5. **Directory Management**: Implement operations to create, delete, and search directories. Directories will be used to organize files in a hierarchical manner.

6. **File Management**: Implement operations to create, read, update, and delete files. This includes handling file data and managing file blocks on disk.

7. **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to optimize file read/write operations for better performance.

8. **Journaling and Recovery**: Implement mechanisms to ensure data consistency and enable recovery from system failures.

9. **Security**: Implement file permissions and access control mechanisms to enforce security.

10. **System Calls**: Create system calls and APIs that applications can use to interact with the file system.

Building a full-featured file system requires a deep understanding of operating systems, disk management, data structures, and low-level programming. It is usually a task reserved for experienced systems programmers.

To get started with learning about file systems and system-level programming, you can explore resources and books on operating systems and file systems. Some popular books in this field are "Operating System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne and "File System Forensic Analysis" by Brian Carrier. Online courses and tutorials on operating systems and file systems are also available.

Keep in mind that building an entire file system like the one used in modern operating systems is a significant undertaking and may require working with low-level programming languages such as C or C++. It's a great challenge for those interested in systems programming and computer science.
