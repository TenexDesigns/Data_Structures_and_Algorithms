Backtracking in the context of Depth-First Search (DFS) in binary trees refers to the process of returning to the parent node after visiting a node and exploring as far as possible along each branch of the tree.

In a DFS traversal of a binary tree, the algorithm starts from the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. 

Heres a step-by-step explanation of how backtracking works in DFS:

1. Start at the root node.
2. Move to the left child node if it exists. If not, move to the right child node.
3. Repeat step 2 until you reach a node with no children (a leaf node).
4. Once you reach a leaf node, backtrack to its parent node.
5. From the parent node, check if there's a right child node. If there is, repeat steps 2-4 for the right child node.
6. If the parent node has no right child node, backtrack to its parent and repeat steps 2-5.

Heres a simple JavaScript example of a DFS with backtracking:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

function dfs(node) {
  if (node === null) {
    return;
  }

  console.log(node.data); // Process the node
  dfs(node.left); // Recurse on the left child
  dfs(node.right); // Recurse on the right child
}

// Construct a binary tree
let root = new Node(1);
root.left = new Node(2);
root.right = new Node(3);
root.left.left = new Node(4);
root.left.right = new Node(5);

dfs(root); // Outputs: 1 2 4 5 3
```
In the above example, the `dfs` function traverses the binary tree in a DFS manner. It first checks if the current node is null. If it's not, it processes the node (in this case, printing the node's data), then recursively calls `dfs` on the left child and the right child. This process continues until all nodes have been visited. When the function calls `dfs` on a null child (indicating a leaf node), it simply returns and continues with the next node, effectively backtracking [Source 0](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1294720/whats-the-difference-between-backtracking-and-depth-first-search), [Source 5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dfs-traversal-of-a-tree-using-recursion/).
