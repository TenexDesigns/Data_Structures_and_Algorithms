Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures in computer science that are used to organize and store data in a hierarchical manner. Lets go through each of them:

Tree Data Structure:
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a root node, which is the topmost node in the hierarchy, and each node can have zero or more child nodes. Nodes with no children are called leaves. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as organizational structures, file systems, and network routing.

A tree is a non-linear data strucure, compared to arrys, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data strucures.  
In linear data  strucures , the time required to search is proportional to the size of the data set.
  Trees however, owing to the nonlinear nature allow quicker and easier access to data.
  A tree will not contain any loops or cycles


Note: ---> Never will you be aked to implement a generic treee, You will only be asked to implment a Binary Search tree.

Trees find their useage in scenarious where Hierachichal represnation of data is necessary
  - File syastems for directory strucure
  - DOM
  - A family tree
  - An organisation tress
  - Chatbots
  - Abstract synatax trees
    
  
Main terms in a tree:

Node: Each element in a tree is called a node. Each node contains data and can have references to its child nodes.
Root: The topmost node in a tree is called the root.
Parent: A node that has child nodes is called a parent node.
Child: Nodes that are connected to a parent node are called child nodes.
Leaf: A node that has no children is called a leaf node.
Edge: The connection between nodes in a tree is called an edge.
Sibling : Nodes with the same parent are called siblings. 
Ancestor:The parent of the parent of a node
Path: Sequence of nodes and edges from one node to another
Distance: Number of edges on the path  between two nodes
Degree: Number of child nodes  a node has.
Depth: Number of edges a node has from the root node
Height:Number of edges from deepest node to that node



Binary Tree
   - A binary tree is a tree data strucure in which each node has at most two children.
   - This children are refered to as left child and right child
    
Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - In a Binary Search Tree, The value of each left node must be smaller than the parent node.
   - The value of each right node must be greater than the parent node.
   - Each node has at most two children   
    

    Binary Search Tree Operations

    Insertion  - To add a node to the tree
    Search - To find a node given its values
    DFS & BFS - To visit all nodes in the tree
    Deletion - To remove a node gven its value.

    Binary Search Tree Usage

    - Searching
    -Sorting
    -To impmennt abstarct data types such as lookups tables and priority queueu
    
Applications of trees:

File systems: Tree structures are used to represent the hierarchical organization of files and folders in a computers file system.
Decision trees: In machine learning, decision trees are used for classification and regression tasks.
Binary expression trees: Trees are used to represent mathematical expressions in a way that can be evaluated efficiently.
Parsing and compilers: Trees are used in parsing and compilation of programming languages.
Binary Search Tree (BST) Data Structure:
A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree that has the following properties:
Each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child.
The value of all nodes in the left subtree of a node is less than the value of the node.
The value of all nodes in the right subtree of a node is greater than or equal to the value of the node.
The left and right subtrees are also BSTs.
The key property of BSTs is that they allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Due to the ordering of nodes, binary search trees enable quick search for specific values.

Applications of Binary Search Trees:

Searching: Binary search trees are used in searching algorithms because of their efficient search operations.
In-order traversal: In-order traversal of a BST returns the values in sorted order, which is useful for processing data in sorted order.
Priority queues: Priority queues can be implemented using BSTs to efficiently find and remove the minimum or maximum value.
Heres a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

class BinarySearchTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  insert(value) {
    const newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.root) {
      this.root = newNode;
      return;
    }

    let current = this.root;
    while (true) {
      if (value < current.value) {
        if (!current.left) {
          current.left = newNode;
          return;
        }
        current = current.left;
      } else {
        if (!current.right) {
          current.right = newNode;
          return;
        }
        current = current.right;
      }
    }
  }

  search(value) {
    let current = this.root;
    while (current) {
      if (value === current.value) {
        return true;
      } else if (value < current.value) {
        current = current.left;
      } else {
        current = current.right;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }

  // In-order traversal
  inOrderTraversal(node = this.root) {
    if (!node) return [];

    const result = [];
    result.push(...this.inOrderTraversal(node.left));
    result.push(node.value);
    result.push(...this.inOrderTraversal(node.right));
    return result;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const myBST = new BinarySearchTree();
myBST.insert(10);
myBST.insert(5);
myBST.insert(15);
myBST.insert(3);
myBST.insert(7);

console.log(myBST.search(7)); // Output: true
console.log(myBST.search(12)); // Output: false

console.log(myBST.inOrderTraversal()); // Output: [3, 5, 7, 10, 15]
In the example above, we implemented a simple Binary Search Tree with methods for inserting nodes, searching for values, and performing an in-order traversal to retrieve the values in sorted order. The implementation demonstrates the core functionality of a BST and its efficient search and insertion operations.

  Trees and Binary Search Trees
Tree Data Structure
A tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node. The first node of the tree is called the root. If this root node is connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the connected node is a child freecodecamp.org.

In a tree, nodes are connected by links called edges. The nodes without children are called leaves. Other important concepts in trees are height and depth. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path to a leaf freecodecamp.org.

// Structure of each node of the tree
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
};
This is an example of a tree node structure in C geeksforgeeks.org.

Binary Tree
A binary tree is a type of tree where each node can have at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node is called the root, and the nodes without children are called leaves geeksforgeeks.org.

Binary trees have many applications in computer science, including data storage and retrieval, expression evaluation, network routing, and game AI. They can also be used to implement various algorithms such as searching, sorting, and graph algorithms geeksforgeeks.org.

Binary Search Tree (BST)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where the left child of a node has a value less than the node’s value and the right child has a value greater than the node’s value. This property is called the BST property and it makes it possible to efficiently search, insert, and delete elements in the tree geeksforgeeks.org.

The root of a BST is the node that has the largest value in the left subtree and the smallest value in the right subtree. Each left subtree is a BST with nodes that have smaller values than the root and each right subtree is a BST with nodes that have larger values than the root geeksforgeeks.org.

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree geeksforgeeks.org.

The BST may have duplicate nodes. The approach to handle duplicate values in BST is either store duplicate values consistently at the left or the right of the root or keep a counter with the node and increment the counter when a duplicate value is found geeksforgeeks.org.

Traversal
There are 3 kinds of traversals typically done over a binary search tree: In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order. An example of in-order traversal is shown below:

void inOrder(struct node* root) {
        // Base case
        if (root == null) {
                return;
        }
        // Travel the left sub-tree first.
        inOrder(root.left);
        // Print the current node value
        printf("%d ", root.data);
        // Travel the right sub-tree next.
        inOrder(root.right);
}
This traversal first goes over the left subtree of the root node, then accesses the current node, followed by the right subtree of the current node freecodecamp.org.

Operations
The various operations that can be performed on a BST include insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. Insertion of a node into a BST always occurs at a leaf. Searching for a key begins from the root till a leaf node. Once a leaf node is found, the new node is added as a child of the leaf node geeksforgeeks.org.
