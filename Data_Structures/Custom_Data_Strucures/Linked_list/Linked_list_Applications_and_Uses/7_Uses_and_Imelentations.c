Sure, here are some more applications, problems, data structures, and algorithms that use linked lists:

1.Circular Linked List:

Application: Circular linked lists are used in scheduling algorithms and tasks that need to repeat in a circular manner.
Problem: Implement a circular linked list and perform insertion and deletion operations.

class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class CircularLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.size = 0;
  }

  append(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    if (!this.head) {
      newNode.next = newNode; // Point to itself for circular property
      this.head = newNode;
    } else {
      newNode.next = this.head.next;
      this.head.next = newNode;
      this.head = newNode;
    }
    this.size++;
  }

  delete() {
    if (!this.head) return null;
    const removedData = this.head.next.data;
    if (this.size === 1) {
      this.head = null;
    } else {
      this.head.next = this.head.next.next;
    }
    this.size--;
    return removedData;
  }
}

// Usage example
const cll = new CircularLinkedList();
cll.append(1);
cll.append(2);
cll.append(3);

console.log(cll.delete()); // Output: 1
console.log(cll.delete()); // Output: 2


    
2.Doubly Linked List:
    
Application: Doubly linked lists are used in situations where you need to traverse both forward and backward in the list.
Problem: Implement a doubly linked list and perform insertion and deletion operations.

To find the intersection node of two linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach. The idea is to traverse both linked lists simultaneously using two pointers until they reach the end or find an intersection point.

Here's the reasoning behind the solution:

1. First, we need to find the lengths of both linked lists.

2. After finding the lengths, we determine the difference in lengths (if any) between the two linked lists.

3. We then reset the two pointers to the heads of the linked lists.

4. Next, we move the pointer of the longer list forward by the difference in lengths so that both pointers are now equidistant from the end of their respective lists.

5. Now, we can traverse both linked lists simultaneously using the two pointers.

6. If there is an intersection between the two linked lists, the two pointers will eventually meet at the intersection node.

7. If there is no intersection, the two pointers will both reach the end of their respective lists without meeting.

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

function getIntersectionNode(headA, headB) {
    function getLength(head) {
        let length = 0;
        while (head) {
            length++;
            head = head.next;
        }
        return length;
    }

    let lengthA = getLength(headA);
    let lengthB = getLength(headB);

    let pointerA = headA;
    let pointerB = headB;

    // Move the longer list's pointer forward by the difference in lengths
    if (lengthA > lengthB) {
        for (let i = 0; i < lengthA - lengthB; i++) {
            pointerA = pointerA.next;
        }
    } else {
        for (let i = 0; i < lengthB - lengthA; i++) {
            pointerB = pointerB.next;
        }
    }

    // Move both pointers simultaneously until they meet or reach the end
    while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
        pointerA = pointerA.next;
        pointerB = pointerB.next;
    }

    // Return the intersection node (or null if there is no intersection)
    return pointerA;
}
```

In this implementation, we use the `getLength` helper function to find the lengths of both linked lists. We then calculate the difference in lengths and move the pointers accordingly. Finally, we traverse both linked lists using the two pointers simultaneously until they meet at the intersection node or reach the end.

The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists, as we traverse each list once. The space complexity is O(1) since we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input linked lists.

    
3.Intersection of Two Linked Lists:
Problem: Given two linked lists, find the node where they intersect (if any).
Solution:

class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function getIntersectionNode(headA, headB) {
  let currA = headA;
  let currB = headB;
  while (currA !== currB) {
    currA = currA === null ? headB : currA.next;
    currB = currB === null ? headA : currB.next;
  }
  return currA;
}

// Usage example
const node1 = new ListNode(1);
const node2 = new ListNode(2);
const node3 = new ListNode(3);

node1.next = node2;
node2.next = node3;

const node4 = new ListNode(4);
const node5 = new ListNode(5);

node4.next = node5;
node5.next = node2; // Intersection point with node2

console.log(getIntersectionNode(node1, node4).val); // Output: 2




  
4.Reverse Nodes in k-Group:
Problem: Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.


  To solve the "Reverse Nodes in k-Group" problem, we need to reverse the nodes of a linked list in groups of size k. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the last remaining nodes should be kept in the original order.

Here's the reasoning behind the solution:

1. First, we need to determine if there are at least k nodes in the linked list to perform the reversal. If not, we don't need to do anything, and we can return the original linked list.

2. If there are k or more nodes, we can start the reversal process. We'll use a sliding window approach to reverse each group of k nodes.

3. We'll iterate through the linked list using two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current group of nodes to be reversed.

4. At each step, we'll move the `end` pointer k steps forward to form a group of k nodes.

5. If the group has exactly k nodes, we'll reverse the nodes in the group, and connect the reversed group to the previous group (if any) or the head of the final linked list (if it's the first group).

6. If the group has fewer than k nodes (i.e., it reaches the end of the linked list), we won't perform any reversal, and we can exit the loop.

7. We'll keep track of the previous group's end to connect it to the current group's start after reversal.

8. Repeat the process until we reach the end of the linked list.

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

function reverseKGroup(head, k) {
    // Helper function to reverse a linked list from 'start' to 'end'
    function reverseLinkedList(start, end) {
        let prev = null;
        let curr = start;
        while (curr !== end) {
            let nextTemp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    // Create a dummy node as the head of the final linked list
    const dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
    dummyHead.next = head;

    let prevGroupEnd = dummyHead;
    let current = head;
    let count = 0;

    while (current) {
        count++;
        if (count % k === 0) {
            // Reach a group of k nodes, reverse the group
            prevGroupEnd = reverseLinkedList(prevGroupEnd.next, current.next);
            current = prevGroupEnd.next;
        } else {
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    return dummyHead.next;
}
```

In this implementation, we use a helper function `reverseLinkedList` to reverse a linked list from a given `start` node to a given `end` node. We iterate through the linked list using the `current` pointer and maintain a `prevGroupEnd` pointer to connect the reversed groups.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we visit each node once. The space complexity is O(1) since we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input linked list.
