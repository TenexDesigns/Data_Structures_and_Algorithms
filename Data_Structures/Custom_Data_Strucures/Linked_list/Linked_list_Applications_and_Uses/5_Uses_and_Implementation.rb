LinkedLinked lists are versatile and can be applied in a variety of scenarios. Here are a few more examples:

1.Implementing Stacks and Queues: 
Linked lists are often used to implement other abstract data types, including stacks and queues. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed (Last-In-First-Out, or LIFO), while in a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed (First-In-First-Out, or FIFO).
    class Node {
        constructor(data) {
            this.data = data;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    class Stack {
        constructor() {
            this.top = null;
        }

        push(data) {
            let newNode = new Node(data);
            if (this.top) {
                newNode.next = this.top;
            }
            this.top = newNode;
        }

        pop() {
            let data = this.top.data;
            this.top = this.top.next;
            return data;
        }
    }

    let stack = new Stack();
    stack.push(1);
    stack.push(2);
    stack.push(3);
    console.log(stack.pop());  // Outputs: 3
    
In this example, a Stack is implemented using a linked list, where each Node is an element in the stack. The push method adds an element to the top of the stack, and the pop method removes an element from the top of the stack .




      
2.Graph Representation: 
      Linked lists can be used to represent graphs, particularly in the form of adjacency lists. Each node of the linked list can represent a vertex of the graph, and its next pointers can represent edges to adjacent vertices.
    class Node {
        constructor(vertex) {
            this.vertex = vertex;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    class Graph {
        constructor(vertices) {
            this.vertices = vertices;
            this.list = Array(vertices).fill(null);
        }

        addEdge(source, destination) {
            let newNode = new Node(destination);
            newNode.next = this.list[source];
            this.list[source] = newNode;

            newNode = new Node(source);
            newNode.next = this.list[destination];
            this.list[destination] = newNode;
        }

        printGraph() {
            for(let i = 0; i < this.vertices; i++) {
                let temp = this.list[i];
                let str = "";
                while(temp) {
                    str += temp.vertex + " -> ";
                    temp = temp.next;
                }
                console.log(str + "null");
            }
        }
    }

    let graph = new Graph(5);
    graph.addEdge(0, 1);
    graph.addEdge(0, 4);
    graph.addEdge(1, 2);
    graph.addEdge(1, 3);
    graph.addEdge(1, 4);
    graph.addEdge(2, 3);
    graph.addEdge(3, 4);
    graph.printGraph();
  
In this example, a Graph is implemented using an array of linked lists, where each Node represents a vertex and its next pointers represent edges to adjacent vertices. The addEdge method adds an edge between two vertices, and the printGraph method displays the adjacency list representation of the graph .




          
3.Dynamic Memory Allocation:
          Linked lists can be used to manage dynamic memory allocation. This is often used in operating systems where the linked list keeps track of free blocks of memory. Each node represents a block of memory, and the next pointer points to the next free block.
    class Node {
        constructor(blockSize) {
            this.blockSize = blockSize;
            this.next = null;
        }
    }

    class Memory {
        constructor() {
            this.head = null;
        }

        addBlock(blockSize) {
            let newNode = new Node(blockSize);
            if (!this.head) {
                this.head = newNode;
            } else {
                let current = this.head;
                while (current.next) {
                    current = current.next;
                }
                current.next = newNode;
            }
        }

        allocateBlock(size) {
            let current = this.head;
            let previous = null;
            while (current) {
                if (current.blockSize >= size) {
                    if (previous) {
                        previous.next = current.next;
                    } else {
                        this.head = this.head.next;
                    }
                    return current.blockSize;
                }
                previous = current;
                current = current.next;
            }
            return null;
        }
    }

    let memory = new Memory();
    memory.addBlock(100);
    memory.addBlock
