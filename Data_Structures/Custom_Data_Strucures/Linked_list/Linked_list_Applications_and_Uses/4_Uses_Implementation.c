Linked lists are versatile and can be applied in a variety of scenarios. Here are a few more examples:

1.Polynomial Representation: 
Linked lists can be used to represent polynomials. Each node of the linked list can represent a term of the polynomial,
where the coefficient and power are stored in the node.
Heres a simplified example:

class Node {
    constructor(coefficient, power) {
        this.coefficient = coefficient;
        this.power = power;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class Polynomial {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }

    addTerm(coefficient, power) {
        let newNode = new Node(coefficient, power);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
        } else {
            let current = this.head;
            while (current.next) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    printPolynomial() {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current) {
            console.log(current.coefficient + "x^" + current.power);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}

let polynomial = new Polynomial();
polynomial.addTerm(3, 2);
polynomial.addTerm(4, 1);
polynomial.addTerm(5, 0);
polynomial.printPolynomial();  // Outputs: "3x^2", "4x^1", "5x^0"
In this example, each Node represents a term of the polynomial, and the Polynomial class maintains a linked list of terms. The addTerm method adds a term to the end of the list, and the printPolynomial method displays the polynomial geeksforgeeks.org.



          
2.Sparse Matrices: 
          Linked lists can also be used to represent sparse matrices efficiently. In a sparse matrix, most of the elements are zero. 
            Therefore, only non-zero elements are stored in the linked list to save space.
A sparse matrix is a matrix that has a significant number of zero elements compared to the total number of elements in the matrix. In contrast, a dense matrix has very few zero elements. Sparse matrices often arise in various applications where most of the data is zero, and representing the entire matrix would be inefficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity.

Sparse matrices are commonly used in diverse fields, including scientific computing, numerical analysis, graph theory, data compression, and more. Some of the specific applications of sparse matrices include:

1. Solving systems of linear equations: Sparse matrices are used in numerical methods to solve large systems of linear equations efficiently.

2. Finite element analysis: In engineering simulations and structural analysis, sparse matrices are used to represent the stiffness and mass matrices of large structures.

3. Graph algorithms: In graph theory, sparse matrices are used to represent adjacency matrices and incidence matrices of graphs.

4. Image and signal processing: Sparse matrices are used in image and signal processing applications, such as compression algorithms like JPEG and wavelet transforms.

Using a linked list to represent a sparse matrix is a common approach due to its memory efficiency. Here's how you can represent a sparse matrix using a linked list:

1. Create a linked list node that stores three pieces of information: row index, column index, and the value of the element.

2. For each non-zero element in the sparse matrix, create a linked list node with the corresponding row index, column index, and element value.

3. Link these nodes together to form a linked list representation of the sparse matrix.

4. You may also keep additional information, such as the dimensions of the original matrix, to facilitate matrix operations.

Let's look at a simple example of representing a sparse matrix using a linked list in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(row, col, value) {
        this.row = row;
        this.col = col;
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class SparseMatrix {
    constructor(rows, cols) {
        this.rows = rows;
        this.cols = cols;
        this.head = null;
    }

    insertElement(row, col, value) {
        const newNode = new Node(row, col, value);
        if (!this.head || this.head.row > row || (this.head.row === row && this.head.col > col)) {
            newNode.next = this.head;
            this.head = newNode;
        } else {
            let curr = this.head;
            while (curr.next && (curr.next.row < row || (curr.next.row === row && curr.next.col < col))) {
                curr = curr.next;
            }
            newNode.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = newNode;
        }
    }

    print() {
        let curr = this.head;
        for (let i = 0; i < this.rows; i++) {
            let rowStr = '';
            for (let j = 0; j < this.cols; j++) {
                if (curr && curr.row === i && curr.col === j) {
                    rowStr += `${curr.value} `;
                    curr = curr.next;
                } else {
                    rowStr += `0 `;
                }
            }
            console.log(rowStr);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage:
const matrix = new SparseMatrix(4, 5);
matrix.insertElement(1, 2, 5);
matrix.insertElement(0, 0, 10);
matrix.insertElement(3, 4, 3);
matrix.insertElement(1, 1, 7);

matrix.print();
```

In this example, we define a `Node` class to represent each non-zero element of the sparse matrix. The `SparseMatrix` class maintains a linked list of `Node` objects, which forms the linked list representation of the sparse matrix. The `insertElement` method inserts a new element into the linked list in the correct position based on the row and column indices. The `print` method displays the sparse matrix in a human-readable format, showing the non-zero elements and zeros in their respective positions.



          
3.Undo Functionality in Software:
          Linked lists can be used to implement undo functionality in software applications. 
            Each node in the linked list can represent a state of the application, and the previous pointer can be used to go back to the previous state.
Undo functionality in software allows users to reverse or revert their previous actions, providing them with the ability to "undo" changes they have made. It is a valuable feature in many applications to prevent accidental mistakes or provide users with the flexibility to experiment and revert changes when needed.

In general, the undo functionality works by maintaining a history of user actions. When a user performs an action (e.g., typing text, moving an object, deleting content),
        the application records the actions details in a data structure. When the user triggers the "undo" action, the application reverses the last recorded action, restoring the previous state.

Implementing Undo Functionality using Linked List:
A doubly linked list is a suitable data structure for implementing undo functionality. Each node of the linked list represents a user action and its relevant details, and the doubly linked list allows for easy traversal in both directions to undo and redo actions.

Heres a simplified example of how to implement undo functionality using a doubly linked list:

class ActionNode {
    constructor(action, data) {
        this.action = action;
        this.data = data;
        this.prev = null;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class UndoManager {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
    }

    addAction(action, data) {
        const newNode = new ActionNode(action, data);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            this.tail = newNode;
        } else {
            newNode.prev = this.tail;
            this.tail.next = newNode;
            this.tail = newNode;
        }
    }

    undo() {
        if (this.tail) {
            const lastAction = this.tail;
            this.tail = lastAction.prev;
            if (this.tail) {
                this.tail.next = null;
            }
            // Perform the reverse action or revert changes based on the recorded data.
            // For example, if you recorded a "delete" action, undoing would involve restoring the deleted content.
            // Similarly, for other actions, you would apply the reverse of the original action.
        }
    }

    redo() {
        // Implement the redo functionality by traversing forward in the doubly linked list.
        // This is where the redo actions would be executed if needed.
    }
}


In this example, the `ActionNode` class represents each user action with its relevant data. The `UndoManager` class maintains a doubly linked list of `ActionNode` objects. When a user performs an action, the application records the action and its details by creating a new `ActionNode` and adding it to the linked list using the `addAction` method. The `undo` method moves back in the history, reversing the last action, and restores the previous state based on the recorded data. The `redo` method allows users to redo actions if they decide to reapply previously undone changes.

Applications of Undo Functionality:
Undo functionality is widely used in various software applications, including:
- Text editors and word processors: Users can undo typing, formatting, and other document changes.
- Graphic design software: Users can undo drawing, moving, or deleting elements.
- Software development environments: Developers can undo code changes and revert to previous versions.
- Drawing and painting applications: Users can undo brush strokes and other artistic changes.
- Spreadsheet applications: Users can undo cell changes and formula updates.
- Video and audio editing software: Users can undo edits to video and audio clips.

The ability to undo actions is essential in user-centric applications, providing users with greater confidence and flexibility in their interactions with the software.
