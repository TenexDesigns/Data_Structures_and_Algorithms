Using Reverse Linked list
*********************************************************************************************************

The approach you've provided is a valid and efficient way to solve the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists. This approach involves reversing the linked lists, performing the addition digit by digit, and then reversing the result back.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of your provided solution and its implementation in JavaScript using the `LinkedList` class:

1. **LinkedList and ListNode Classes:** You have defined the `ListNode` and `LinkedList` classes to represent nodes and linked lists. `LinkedList` class includes a method `append` to add values to the linked list and a `reverse` method to reverse the linked list.

2. **Reverse Linked Lists:** You create two new instances of `LinkedList` named `reversedList1` and `reversedList2`. You set their `head` to the respective `head` of `list1` and `list2`, and then reverse both linked lists using the `reverse` method.

3. **Addition with Carry:** You iterate through both `reversedList1` and `reversedList2` while adding their values along with the carry. If the sum of values and carry is greater than or equal to 10, you append the least significant digit to the result and update the carry. Otherwise, you directly append the sum to the result with carry set to 0.

4. **Reverse and Return Result:** After the addition is complete, you reverse the `result` linked list using the `reverse` method and return it as the final result.

Here's your provided solution with some additional comments:

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val) {
      this.val = val;
      this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
      this.head = null;
    }
  
    append(val) {
      const newNode = new ListNode(val);
      if (!this.head) {
        this.head = newNode;
      } else {
        let current = this.head;
        while (current.next) {
          current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
      }
    }

    reverse() {
      let prev = null;
      let current = this.head;
      while (current) {
        const next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
      }
      this.head = prev;
    }
}

function addTwoNumbers(list1, list2) {
    const reversedList1 = new LinkedList();
    const reversedList2 = new LinkedList();
    
    // Reverse the input linked lists
    reversedList1.head = list1.head;
    reversedList2.head = list2.head;
    reversedList1.reverse();
    reversedList2.reverse();
    
    const result = new LinkedList();
    let current1 = reversedList1.head;
    let current2 = reversedList2.head;
    let carry = 0;

    while (current1 !== null || current2 !== null || carry === 1)  {
        const val1 = current1 ? current1.val : 0;
        const val2 = current2 ? current2.val : 0;
        const sum = val1 + val2 + carry;

        if (sum >= 10) {
            let num = Math.floor(sum % 10);
            result.append(num);
            carry = 1;
        } else {
            result.append(sum);
            carry = 0;
        }
    
        if (current1) current1 = current1.next;
        if (current2) current2 = current2.next;
    }

    return result.reverse();
}
```

This solution works correctly and efficiently for adding two numbers represented by linked lists. It follows the process of reversing the input linked lists, performing digit-wise addition with carry, and reversing the result linked list before returning it.












Reverse the direction of the linked list
*********************************************************************************************************


Yes, it is possible to reverse the pointers in a linked list to change the direction of the list. Reversing the pointers is a common technique to reverse the order of a linked list without modifying the data values themselves.

In your example, reversing the pointers of the linked list `1->9->9->null` would result in `9->9->1->null`.

This approach is certainly valid and can be used as an alternative to the reverse linked list approach. Reversing the pointers is usually more memory-efficient and faster, as it only involves changing the pointers and does not require creating a new linked list.

Here's how you can implement this approach to add two numbers represented by linked lists:

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val) {
      this.val = val;
      this.next = null;
    }
}

function addTwoNumbers(list1, list2) {
    reverseList(list1); // Reverse the pointers of list1
    reverseList(list2); // Reverse the pointers of list2
    
    const result = new ListNode(0); // Dummy node to simplify the addition
    let current = result;
    let carry = 0;

    while (list1 !== null || list2 !== null || carry !== 0) {
        const val1 = list1 ? list1.val : 0;
        const val2 = list2 ? list2.val : 0;
        const sum = val1 + val2 + carry;

        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
        current = current.next;

        if (list1) list1 = list1.next;
        if (list2) list2 = list2.next;
    }

    reverseList(result.next); // Reverse the pointers of the result

    return result.next;
}

function reverseList(head) {
    let prev = null;
    let current = head;
    while (current) {
        const next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return prev; // Return the new head after reversing
}
```

In this implementation, the `reverseList` function is used to reverse the pointers of a linked list. The `addTwoNumbers` function uses this approach to add two numbers represented by linked lists. The final result is obtained by reversing the pointers of the result linked list.

This approach is memory-efficient and performs the addition without creating a new linked list. However, the choice between this approach and the reverse linked list approach depends on factors such as coding style, readability, and specific requirements of your application.







This implementation reverses the pointers of each node in the linked list, effectively reversing the direction of the list. The function takes the head of the original list as input and returns the head of the reversed list.

Reversing the pointers of the linked list is a common approach to reverse the direction of the list. It is a simple and efficient way to achieve the desired result.
