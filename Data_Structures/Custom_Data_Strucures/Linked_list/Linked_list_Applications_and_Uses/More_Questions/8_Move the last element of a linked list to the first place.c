To move the last element of a linked list to the first place, you need to traverse the list to find the last node and then adjust the next pointers of nodes to move the last node to the front.

**Approach:**
1. Start from the head of the linked list and traverse the list until you reach the last node (`node.next === null`).
2. Keep track of the previous node (`prev`) of the last node.
3. Adjust the `next` pointer of `prev` to `null` to disconnect the last node from the list.
4. Set the `next` pointer of the last node to the current head of the list.
5. Update the head of the linked list to the last node.

**Which linked list to use:**
To use this approach, you need to have access to the head of the linked list.

**Reasoning behind the solution:**
The approach relies on traversing the linked list to find the last node while keeping track of the previous node. By adjusting the `next` pointers accordingly, we can move the last node to the front of the list.

Here's a JavaScript implementation of moving the last element of a linked list to the first place:

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function moveLastToFirst(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    // If the list is empty or has only one node, nothing to do
    return head;
  }

  let current = head;
  let prev = null;

  // Traverse to find the last node and its previous node
  while (current.next) {
    prev = current;
    current = current.next;
  }

  // Disconnect the last node from the list
  prev.next = null;

  // Move the last node to the front
  current.next = head;
  head = current;

  return head;
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. The `moveLastToFirst` function takes the head of the linked list as an input parameter.

2. It checks if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, there's no need to move the last node, and the function returns the head as it is.

3. The function initializes two pointers, `current` and `prev`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.

4. The `while` loop runs until `current.next` is `null`, indicating that `current` is the last node. Inside the loop:

   a. The `prev` pointer is updated to point to the current node.

   b. The `current` pointer moves to the next node.

5. After the loop, `current` points to the last node, and `prev` points to the node before the last node.

6. The function disconnects the last node from the list by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node to `null` (`prev.next = null`).

7. The function moves the last node to the front by setting its `next` pointer to the current head of the list (`current.next = head`).

8. Finally, the head of the linked list is updated to the last node, and the function returns the new head of the list.

To use this function, you can create a linked list and then call the `moveLastToFirst` function with the head of the linked list. The function will return the head of the linked list with the last element moved to the first place.
