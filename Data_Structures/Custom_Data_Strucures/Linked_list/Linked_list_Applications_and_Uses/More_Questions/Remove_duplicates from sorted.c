To remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a hash set to keep track of the unique values encountered in the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list from the head node.
3. For each node, check if its value is already present in the hash set.
4. If the value is not present, add it to the hash set and move to the next node.
5. If the value is already present, remove the duplicate node by updating the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the duplicate node.
6. Continue traversing the linked list until all nodes have been processed.

Heres the code implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
  }
}

function removeDuplicates(head) {
  if (head === null) {
    return null; // Empty list
  }

  const set = new Set();
  let current = head;
  let previous = null;

  while (current !== null) {
    if (set.has(current.val)) {
      // Duplicate node found, remove it
      previous.next = current.next;
    } else {
      // Unique value, add it to the set
      set.add(current.val);
      previous = current;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }

  return head;
}
```

The reasoning behind this solution is to use a hash set to keep track of the unique values encountered in the linked list. By traversing the linked list and checking each node's value against the hash set, we can identify and remove duplicate nodes.

To remove a duplicate node, we update the `next` pointer of the previous node to skip the duplicate node, effectively removing it from the linked list.

By using a hash set, we can efficiently check for duplicate values in constant time. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

To remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list in JavaScript, you have two approaches: the hashing approach and the sorting approach.

Approach 1: Hashing Approach

In this approach, you use a hash table (JavaScript object) to keep track of the elements and remove duplicates.

1. Initialize an empty hash table.
2. Iterate through the linked list.
3. For each node, check if its value already exists in the hash table.
   - If it does, remove the node from the linked list.
   - If it doesn't, add the node's value to the hash table.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the linked list.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function removeDuplicates(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return head; // Empty list or single node list has no duplicates
  }

  const hashTable = {};
  let current = head;
  let prev = null;

  while (current) {
    if (hashTable[current.value]) {
      prev.next = current.next; // Remove duplicate node
    } else {
      hashTable[current.value] = true;
      prev = current;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }

  return head;
}
```

Approach 2: Sorting Approach

In this approach, you sort the linked list and then remove duplicates by comparing adjacent nodes.

1. Sort the linked list using any sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quicksort). Make sure to update the `next` pointers accordingly during sorting.
2. Iterate through the sorted list.
3. Compare the value of the current node with the value of the next node.
   - If they are equal, remove the next node from the linked list.
   - If they are not equal, move to the next node.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the linked list.

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

function removeDuplicates(head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return head; // Empty list or single node list has no duplicates
  }

  let current = head;

  while (current && current.next) {
    if (current.value === current.next.value) {
      current.next = current.next.next; // Remove duplicate node
    } else {
      current = current.next;
    }
  }

  return head;
}
```

You can test both implementations with the following example:

```javascript
const linkedList = new Node(12);
linkedList.next = new Node(11);
linkedList.next.next = new Node(12);
linkedList.next.next.next = new Node(21);
linkedList.next.next.next.next = new Node(41);
linkedList.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(43);
linkedList.next.next.next.next.next.next = new Node(21);

console.log("Linked List before removing duplicates:");
console.log(JSON.stringify(linkedList));

const updatedList = removeDuplicates(linkedList);

console.log("Linked List after removing duplicates:");
console.log(JSON.stringify(updatedList));
```

In this example, we create an unsorted linked list containing duplicate elements. We call the `removeDuplicates` function to remove the duplicates, and then we print the linked list before and after the removal.

I hope this clarifies both approaches and their implementations. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
