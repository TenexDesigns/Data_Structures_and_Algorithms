Calculating the factorial of big numbers can lead to very large results, which might exceed the range of standard number representations in JavaScript. To handle such large numbers, you can use a linked list to represent the digits of the factorial result.

**Approach:**
1. Create a linked list class that will represent the digits of the factorial result.
2. Initialize the linked list with a single node containing the value 1, which represents the factorial of 1.
3. Implement a function to multiply the linked list by a number (representing the next factorial number).
4. For each number from 2 to the target number, multiply the linked list with that number to calculate the factorial iteratively.
5. The final result will be stored in the linked list, and you can convert it to any desired representation (e.g., a string) for further use.

**Linked List Implementation:**
Let's define a linked list class that will represent the digits of the factorial result.

```javascript
class ListNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  append(val) {
    const newNode = new ListNode(val);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
    } else {
      let current = this.head;
      while (current.next) {
        current = current.next;
      }
      current.next = newNode;
    }
  }
}
```

**Factorial Calculation:**
Now, let's implement the factorial calculation using the linked list.

```javascript
function multiplyList(list, num) {
  let current = list.head;
  let carry = 0;

  while (current) {
    let product = current.val * num + carry;
    current.val = product % 10;
    carry = Math.floor(product / 10);
    if (current.next === null && carry > 0) {
      list.append(carry);
      carry = 0;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }
}

function factorialOfBigNumber(n) {
  const result = new LinkedList();
  result.append(1);

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    multiplyList(result, i);
  }

  return result;
}
```

**Usage:**
Now you can use the `factorialOfBigNumber` function to calculate the factorial of large numbers.

```javascript
const number = 100; // Example: Calculate factorial of 100
const resultLinkedList = factorialOfBigNumber(number);

// Convert the linked list to a string for display
let resultString = "";
let current = resultLinkedList.head;
while (current) {
  resultString = current.val + resultString;
  current = current.next;
}

console.log(`Factorial of ${number}: ${resultString}`);
```

**Explanation:**
1. We define a `ListNode` class to represent each node in the linked list, with a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).

2. The `LinkedList` class provides the functionality to append nodes to the list. It also has a `head` pointer to keep track of the start of the list.

3. The `multiplyList` function multiplies the linked list with a given number. It goes through the list, multiplying each digit with the number and handling the carry for each multiplication. The result is stored back in the linked list.

4. The `factorialOfBigNumber` function calculates the factorial of the input number using a linked list. It initializes the linked list with a single node containing the value 1, and then iteratively multiplies it with numbers from 2 to the input number.

5. The final result will be stored in the linked list. To display the result, we convert the linked list to a string by traversing it in reverse order and concatenating the digits.

This implementation efficiently handles the factorial of big numbers using a linked list, allowing you to represent and compute the factorial of numbers that might exceed the limitations of standard JavaScript number representations.
