A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list freecodecamp.org.

Each element (commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node. The data can be any valid data type. The entry point to a linked list is called the head. The head is a reference to the first node in the linked list. The last node on the list points to null. If a list is empty, the head is a null reference freecodecamp.org.

Here is an example of a linked list:

const list = {
    head: {
        value: 6,
        next: {
            value: 10,                                            
            next: {
                value: 12,
                next: {
                    value: 3,
                    next: null	
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
And here is how you can implement a list node in JavaScript:

class ListNode {
    constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;                
    }
}
And a linked list:

class LinkedList {
    constructor(head = null) {
        this.head = head;
    }
}
Linked lists are used in many different scenarios in computer science. They are used to implement stacks, queues, and other data structures. They are also used in many algorithms freecodecamp.org.

There are several types of linked lists including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists and circular linked lists:

A singly linked list is the simplest type of linked list, based on the concept of collection of nodes. Nodes are connected in a sequential manner and each node contains the address of its adjacent node and data scaler.com.
A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a reference to its previous node as well as its next node. This allows for more efficient insertions and deletions at both ends of the list sebhastian.com.
A circular linked list is a variation of linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or doubly circular linked list scaler.com.
Here is a basic implementation of a doubly linked list in JavaScript:

class DoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
    }

    append(value) {
        if (!this.tail) {
            this.head = this.tail = new Node(value);
        } else {
            let oldTail = this.tail;
            this.tail = new Node(value);
            oldTail.next = this.tail;
            this.tail.prev = oldTail;
        }
    }

    delete(value) {
        let currentNode = this.head;

        while (currentNode) {
            if (currentNode.value === value) {
                if (currentNode === this.head && currentNode === this.tail) {
                    this.head = this.tail = null;
                } else if (currentNode === this.head) {
                    this.head = this.head.next;
                    this.head.prev = null;
                } else if (currentNode === this.tail) {
                    this.tail = this.tail.prev;
                    this.tail.next = null;
                } else {
                    currentNode.prev.next = currentNode.next;
                    currentNode.next.prev = currentNode.prev;
                }
            } 

            currentNode = currentNode.next;
        }
    }
}

class Node {
    constructor(value, prev, next) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = next || null;
        this.prev = prev || null;
    }
}
This implementation includes append and delete methods sebhastian.com.

In a stack, a linked list can be used to implement the stack data structure. The next pointer can be used to keep track of the top element of the stack. The push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations can be implemented easily using a linked list.

In a queue, a linked list can be used to implement the queue data structure. Two pointers, front and rear, can be used to track the front and the rear of the queue.
