A linked data structure is a type of data structure that consists of a collection of elements called nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked data structures are used to store and organize data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements. There are several types of linked data structures, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

A linked list is a linear data strucure that inliced a series of connected nodes
  Each node consits of a data value and a pointter that points to th next node

  The list elemnts can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorgnisation of the entire strucure

  Random acccess of elemnts is not feasible and accessing an elemnt  has linear time complexity.

  The linked list data strucure supports three main operations
     -> Insertion - To add an elemnt at the begining and end or at a given index in the list
     -> Deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
     -> Search - to find an  elemnt given its value.

Here are some key points about linked data structures:

Node: Each element in a linked data structure is represented by a node. The node contains two parts: the data (or value) that represents the element and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Singly Linked List: In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence, forming a unidirectional chain. The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

Doubly Linked List: In a doubly linked list, each node points to both the next and the previous node in the sequence, forming a bidirectional chain. The first nodes previous pointer and the last nodes next pointer point to null.

Circular Linked List: A circular linked list is a variation of a singly or doubly linked list in which the last node points back to the first node (in case of singly linked circular list) or the first nodes previous pointer points to the last node (in case of doubly linked circular list).

Dynamic Size: Linked data structures allow for dynamic sizing, meaning elements can be easily added or removed without the need to resize the structure.

Insertion and Deletion: Inserting and deleting elements in a linked data structure is efficient, typically requiring only O(1) time complexity for both operations, given that you have a reference to the position where the insertion or deletion should occur.

Traversal: Traversing a linked data structure is relatively straightforward, as you can follow the pointers from one node to the next.

Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked data structures do not provide constant-time random access to elements. To access an element, you need to traverse the list from the beginning.

Linked data structures are widely used in computer science and programming for various applications, such as implementing data caches, managing memory, representing graphs and trees, and implementing various data structures like stacks and queues.

Heres a simple example of implementing a singly linked list in JavaScript:

class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  append(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
      return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
      current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
  }

  print() {
    let current = this.head;
    const result = [];
    while (current) {
      result.push(current.data);
      current = current.next;
    }
    console.log(result);
  }
}

// Example usage:
const myList = new LinkedList();
myList.append(1);
myList.append(2);
myList.append(3);

myList.print(); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
In the example above, we implemented a simple singly linked list with a Node class and a LinkedList class. The append method adds elements to the end of the list, and the print method visualizes the elements in the list.
