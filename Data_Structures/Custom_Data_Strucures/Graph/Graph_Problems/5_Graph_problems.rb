Graphs are powerful data structures that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. Here are a few problems and their solutions using graph algorithms in JavaScript:

Finding the shortest path between two nodes (Dijkstra's Algorithm): This problem is common in routing where you need to find the shortest path between two points.
function dijkstra(graph, source) {
    let distance = {};
    for (let node in graph) {
        distance[node] = Infinity;
    }
    distance[source] = 0;

    let unvisited = new Set(Object.keys(graph));
    let previous = {};

    while (unvisited.size) {
        let currNode = getSmallestNode(unvisited, distance);
        unvisited.delete(currNode);

        for (let neighbor in graph[currNode]) {
            let distanceFromSource = graph[currNode][neighbor] + distance[currNode];
            if (distanceFromSource < distance[neighbor]) {
                distance[neighbor] = distanceFromSource;
                previous[neighbor] = currNode;
            }
        }
    }
    return { distance, previous };
}

function getSmallestNode(unvisited, distance) {
    return Array.from(unvisited).reduce((minNode, node) => (distance[node] < distance[minNode] ? node : minNode));
}

Detecting a cycle in a Graph (Depth First Traversal): This is useful in situations like deadlock detection in a system of processes where resources are shared among processes.
function isCyclicUtil(graph, v, visited, parent) {
    visited[v] = true;

    for(let i = 0; i < graph[v].length; ++i) {
        let vertex = graph[v][i];

        if(!visited[vertex]) {
            if(isCyclicUtil(graph, vertex, visited, v)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        else if(vertex !== parent) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

function isCyclic(graph) {
    let visited = [];
    for(let i = 0; i < graph.length; ++i) {
        visited[i] = false;
    }

    for(let u = 0; u < graph.length; ++u) {
        if(!visited[u]) {
            if(isCyclicUtil(graph, u, visited, -1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Finding a path between two nodes (Depth or Breadth First Search): This can be used in games to find a path from one point to another.
function depthFirstSearch(graph, start, end, visited = new Set()) {
    if (start === end) return true;

    visited.add(start);
    for (let neighbor of graph[start]) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
            if (depthFirstSearch(graph, neighbor, end, visited)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

These are just a few examples of problems that can be solved using graph data structures and algorithms. There are many other graph algorithms that can solve a wide variety of problems, including finding connected components in a graph, finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, and many others.Graphs are a powerful data structure that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Here are a few examples of problems and their solutions using graph algorithms:

Path Finding (Dijkstra's Algorithm): This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is widely used in GPS devices to find the shortest route between the current location and the destination.
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.nodes = {};
  }

  addNode(node) {
    this.nodes[node] = {};
  }

  addEdge(node1, node2, weight = 1) {
    this.nodes[node1][node2] = weight;
    this.nodes[node2][node1] = weight;
  }

  path(fromNode, toNode) {
    let distances = {};
    let previous = {};
    let queue = new PriorityQueue();

    // Set the initial state of the distances, previous, and queue.
    for (let node in this.nodes) {
      distances[node] = Infinity;
      previous[node] = null;
      if (node === fromNode) {
        distances[node] = 0;
        queue.enqueue(node, 0);
      } else {
        queue.enqueue(node);
      }
    }

    // Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm.
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
      let shortestNode = queue.dequeue();

      for (let neighbor in this.nodes[shortestNode]) {
        let distance = distances[shortestNode] + this.nodes[shortestNode][neighbor];

        if (distance < distances[neighbor]) {
          distances[neighbor] = distance;
          previous[neighbor] = shortestNode;
          queue.enqueue(neighbor, distance);
        }
      }
    }

    // Return the path from `fromNode` to `toNode`.
    let node = toNode;
    let path = [];

    while (node) {
      path.unshift(node);
      node = previous[node];
    }

    return path;
  }
}

Cycle Detection (Depth-First Search): This algorithm is used to check if a graph contains a cycle. It is used in many areas of computer science, including operating systems, data networks, etc.
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = new Map();
  }

  addNode(node) {
    this.adjList.set(node, []);
  }

  addEdge(node1, node2) {
    this.adjList.get(node1).push(node2);
    this.adjList.get(node2).push(node1);
  }

  isCyclicUtil(node, visited, parent) {
    visited[node] = true;

    for(let neighbor of this.adjList.get(node)) {
      if (!visited[neighbor]) {
        if (this.isCyclicUtil(neighbor, visited, node)) {
          return true;
        }
      } else if (neighbor !== parent) {
        return true;
      }
    }

    return false;
  }

  isCyclic() {
    let visited = {};
    for (let node of this.adjList.keys()) {
      visited[node] = false;
    }

    for (let node of this.adjList.keys()) {
      if (!visited[node]) {
        if (this.isCyclicUtil(node, visited, -1)) {
          return true;
        }
      }
    }

    return false;
  }
}

Finding Connected Components (Depth-First Search): This algorithm is used to find all the connected components in a graph. It is used in many applications, such as social networks, web crawling, network broadcasting, etc.
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = new Map();
  }

  addNode(node) {
    this.adjList.set(node, []);
  }

  addEdge(node1, node2) {
    this.adjList.get(node1).push(node2);
    this.adjList.get(node2).push(node1);
  }

  dfsUtil(node, visited) {
    visited[node] = true;
    console.log(node);

    for(let neighbor of this.adjList.get(node)) {
      if (!visited[neighbor]) {
        this.dfsUtil(neighbor, visited);
      }
    }
  }

  connectedComponents() {
    let visited = {};
    for (let node of this.adjList.keys()) {
      visited[node] = false;
    }

    for (let node of this.adjList.keys()) {
      if (!visited[node]) {
        this.dfsUtil(node, visited);
      }
    }
  }
}
