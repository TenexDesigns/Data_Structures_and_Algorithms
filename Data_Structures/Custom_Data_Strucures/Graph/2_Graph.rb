Graph Data Structure in JavaScript
A graph is a non-linear data structure that contains a set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges. Each edge connects a pair of vertices. A graph can be either directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges do not have a direction). Graphs are used in many different fields of computer science, including network analysis, pathfinding algorithms, and even in social networks geeksforgeeks.org.

Here is an example of a graph data structure in JavaScript:

class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjacencyList = {};
    }
}
In this implementation, the Graph class is constructed with an adjacency list, which is an object that will store each vertex of the graph.

Methods of Graph in JavaScript
Common methods that can be implemented on a Graph include:

addVertex(vertex): This method adds a new vertex to the graph.
    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];
    }

addEdge(vertex1, vertex2): This method adds an edge between two vertices in the graph.
    addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push(vertex2);
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push(vertex1);
    }

removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2): This method removes an edge between two vertices in the graph.
    removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1] = this.adjacencyList[vertex1].filter(
            v => v !== vertex2
        );
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2] = this.adjacencyList[vertex2].filter(
            v => v !== vertex1
        );
    }

removeVertex(vertex): This method removes a vertex and all edges connected to that vertex from the graph.
    removeVertex(vertex) {
        while(this.adjacencyList[vertex].length) {
            const adjacentVertex = this.adjacencyList[vertex].pop();
            this.removeEdge(vertex, adjacentVertex);
        }
        delete this.adjacencyList[vertex];
    }

Additional methods can be created for traversing the graph, such as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) jarednielsen.com.

Time Complexity
The time complexity for operations in a Graph can be as follows:

Add Vertex: O(1)
Add Edge: O(1)
Remove Vertex: O(|V| + |E|)
Remove Edge: O(E)
Query: O(|V| + |E|)
Storage: O(|V| + |E|)
These complexities are due to the fact that were using an adjacency list to represent our graph. An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For queries, such as checking if a particular edge exists between two vertices, we would need to traverse through the list of vertices and edges in the worst case scenario adrianmejia.com.
