Sure, lets go through the graph data structure implementation provided in the code and explain each method:

javascript
Copy code
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjacencyList = new Map();
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex)) {
      this.adjacencyList.set(vertex, new Set());
    }
  }

  addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex1)) {
      this.addVertex(vertex1);
    }
    if (!this.adjacencyList.has(vertex2)) {
      this.addVertex(vertex2);
    }

    this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1).add(vertex2);
    this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2).add(vertex1);
  }

  hasEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1) || !this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1)) {
      return "This vertex is not available";
    } else {
      return (
        this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1).has(vertex2) &&
        this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2).has(vertex1)
      );
    }
  }

  display() {
    console.log(this.adjacencyList);
  }

  removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    this.adjacencyList.get(vertex1).delete(vertex2);
    this.adjacencyList.get(vertex2).delete(vertex1);
  }

  removeVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjacencyList.get(vertex)) {
      return "Vertex is not there";
    }
    for (let connectedVertex of this.adjacencyList.get(vertex)) {
      this.removeEdge(vertex, connectedVertex);
    }

    this.adjacencyList.delete(vertex);
  }
}
Explanation of methods:

constructor(): Initializes the graph with an empty adjacency list using a Map.

addVertex(vertex): Adds a new vertex to the graph. It checks if the vertex is not already present in the adjacency list and adds it with an empty Set to represent its connections (edges).

addEdge(vertex1, vertex2): Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph. If the vertices are not already present in the adjacency list, they are added. It adds vertex2 to the adjacency list of vertex1, and vice versa, representing a bi-directional edge.

hasEdge(vertex1, vertex2): Checks if there is an edge between two vertices in the graph. It verifies that both vertices exist in the adjacency list and checks if they have a connection (edge) with each other.

display(): Displays the adjacency list representation of the graph.

removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2): Removes an edge between two vertices in the graph. It removes vertex2 from the adjacency list of vertex1, and vice versa.

removeVertex(vertex): Removes a vertex from the graph. It first removes all the edges associated with the vertex and then deletes the vertex from the adjacency list.

Now, lets see how to use this graph implementation:

javascript
Copy code
const graph = new Graph();

graph.addVertex("A");
graph.addVertex("B");
graph.addVertex("C");

graph.addEdge("A", "B");
graph.addEdge("B", "C");

graph.display();

console.log(graph.hasEdge("A", "C"));

graph.removeEdge("A", "B");

graph.display();
The above code creates a graph with three vertices "A", "B", and "C" and two edges "A" - "B" and "B" - "C". The display() method will show the adjacency list of the graph, and the hasEdge() method will check if there is an edge between "A" and "C". After removing the edge between "A" and "B", the display() method will show the updated adjacency list.

Graphs are used to represent complex relationships and connections between entities. They find applications in various fields such as computer networking, social networks, routing algorithms, and more. The graph data structure allows efficient storage and manipulation of graph-related information.
