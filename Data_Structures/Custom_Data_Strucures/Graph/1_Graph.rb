In JavaScript, a graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of edges connecting these vertices. Graphs can be used to represent various real-world relationships, such as social networks, transportation networks, and more.

Graphs can be categorized into two main types: directed graphs (digraphs) and undirected graphs. In directed graphs, edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship, while undirected graphs have symmetric relationships without any direction.

Methods and Operations of Graphs in JavaScript:

Add Vertex: To add a new vertex (node) to the graph.

Add Edge: To add a new edge between two vertices.

Remove Vertex: To remove a vertex and all its associated edges from the graph.

Remove Edge: To remove an edge between two vertices.

Get Neighbors: To get all the neighboring vertices of a given vertex.

Get Vertex Count: To get the total number of vertices in the graph.

Get Edge Count: To get the total number of edges in the graph.

Depth-First Search (DFS): To traverse the graph in a depth-first manner.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): To traverse the graph in a breadth-first manner.

Time Complexity of Graph Methods:

Add Vertex: O(1)
Add Edge: O(1)
Remove Vertex: O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices, and |E| is the number of edges.
Remove Edge: O(1)
Get Neighbors: O(|V|), where |V| is the number of vertices.
Get Vertex Count: O(1)
Get Edge Count: O(1)
DFS and BFS: O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices, and |E| is the number of edges.
JavaScript Implementation of Graph:

Below is a basic implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency list representation:

javascript
Copy code
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.vertices = new Map();
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.vertices.has(vertex)) {
      this.vertices.set(vertex, []);
    }
  }

  addEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    this.addVertex(vertex1);
    this.addVertex(vertex2);
    this.vertices.get(vertex1).push(vertex2);
    this.vertices.get(vertex2).push(vertex1);
  }

  removeVertex(vertex) {
    if (this.vertices.has(vertex)) {
      const neighbors = this.vertices.get(vertex);
      neighbors.forEach((neighbor) => {
        this.removeEdge(vertex, neighbor);
      });
      this.vertices.delete(vertex);
    }
  }

  removeEdge(vertex1, vertex2) {
    if (this.vertices.has(vertex1) && this.vertices.has(vertex2)) {
      const neighbors1 = this.vertices.get(vertex1);
      const neighbors2 = this.vertices.get(vertex2);
      this.vertices.set(
        vertex1,
        neighbors1.filter((neighbor) => neighbor !== vertex2)
      );
      this.vertices.set(
        vertex2,
        neighbors2.filter((neighbor) => neighbor !== vertex1)
      );
    }
  }

  getNeighbors(vertex) {
    return this.vertices.get(vertex) || [];
  }

  vertexCount() {
    return this.vertices.size;
  }

  edgeCount() {
    let count = 0;
    this.vertices.forEach((neighbors) => {
      count += neighbors.length;
    });
    return count / 2; // Divide by 2 since each edge is counted twice in the adjacency list.
  }

  dfs(startVertex, visited = new Set()) {
    if (!this.vertices.has(startVertex)) return;
    console.log(startVertex);
    visited.add(startVertex);
    for (const neighbor of this.vertices.get(startVertex)) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        this.dfs(neighbor, visited);
      }
    }
  }

  bfs(startVertex) {
    if (!this.vertices.has(startVertex)) return;
    const queue = [startVertex];
    const visited = new Set([startVertex]);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
      const vertex = queue.shift();
      console.log(vertex);
      for (const neighbor of this.vertices.get(vertex)) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          visited.add(neighbor);
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

// Example usage:
const myGraph = new Graph();
myGraph.addEdge('A', 'B');
myGraph.addEdge('A', 'C');
myGraph.addEdge('B', 'C');
myGraph.addEdge('B', 'D');
myGraph.addVertex('E');

console.log(myGraph.getNeighbors('B')); // Output: [ 'A', 'C', 'D' ]
console.log(myGraph.vertexCount()); // Output: 5
console.log(myGraph.edgeCount()); // Output: 4

myGraph.dfs('A'); // Output: A B C D
myGraph.bfs('A'); // Output: A B C D
In the example above, we implemented a basic undirected graph using an adjacency list representation. The graph provides methods for adding vertices, adding edges, removing vertices and edges, getting neighbors, and traversing the graph using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). The time complexity of these methods is generally O(1) or O(|V| + |E|), where |V| is the number of vertices, and |E| is the number of edges.
