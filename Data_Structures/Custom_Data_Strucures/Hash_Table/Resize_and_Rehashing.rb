Resizing a hash table and rehashing the elements is a technique used to maintain optimal performance as the number of entries in the hash table increases. The load factor, which is the ratio of the number of entries to the size of the hash table, is used to decide when to resize the table. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (commonly 0.75), the size of the hash table is increased (usually doubled), and all entries are rehashed and placed into the new larger table.

Heres a simple implementation of this technique in JavaScript:


class HashTable {
  constructor(initialCapacity = 8) {
    this.buckets = new Array(initialCapacity);
    this.numBuckets = this.buckets.length;
    this.size = 0;
    this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.75;
  }

  hash(key) {
    let hashValue = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hashValue += key.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return hashValue % this.numBuckets;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const index = this.hash(key);

    if (!this.buckets[index]) this.buckets[index] = [];

    this.buckets[index].push([key, value]);
    this.size++;

    if (this.size / this.numBuckets > this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR) {
      this.resize();
    }
  }

  resize() {
    const oldBuckets = this.buckets;
    this.numBuckets *= 2; // double the size
    this.buckets = new Array(this.numBuckets);
    this.size = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < oldBuckets.length; i++) {
      if (oldBuckets[i]) {
        for (let j = 0; j < oldBuckets[i].length; j++) {
          this.set(oldBuckets[i][j][0], oldBuckets[i][j][1]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}


      In this example, the set method inserts a key-value pair into the hash table, and checks if the load factor (size / numBuckets) exceeds the MAX_LOAD_FACTOR (0.75). If it does, the resize method is called to create a new array that is twice the size of the current one. All existing entries are then rehashed and inserted into the new array using the set method.

This approach ensures that the load factor of the hash table stays below the threshold, which helps maintain the performance of operations such as insertions and lookups scaler.com, rvbsanjose.github.io.
