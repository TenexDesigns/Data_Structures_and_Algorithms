The load factor is an important metric used in hash tables to measure how full the hash table is. It is calculated by dividing the number of elements (key-value pairs) currently stored in the hash table by the total number of slots (buckets) available in the hash table. In other words, it is the ratio of the occupied slots to the total slots.

Load Factor = Number of elements in the hash table / Total number of slots in the hash table

A low load factor indicates that the hash table has plenty of available slots and is not heavily occupied. On the other hand, a high load factor suggests that many slots are occupied, and the hash table is nearing its capacity, increasing the likelihood of collisions.

To avoid collisions and maintain a low load factor, it is essential to monitor the load factor as elements are added to the hash table. When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 0.7 or 0.8), it is an indication that the hash table is becoming crowded, and there is a higher chance of collisions.

To handle this situation, one common approach is to dynamically resize the hash table and rehash the existing elements. Resizing involves increasing the number of slots available in the hash table. For example, if the current load factor exceeds the threshold, we can double the size of the hash table by creating a new array with double the number of slots and rehashing all the existing elements to fit into the new structure.

Here are the steps when resizing the hash table:

Create a new array with double the number of slots.
Iterate through the existing elements in the old hash table and rehash each element to fit into the new array.
Insert the rehashed elements into the new hash table.
Update the hash tables properties (e.g., numBuckets and size) to reflect the changes.
By resizing and rehashing, we effectively reduce the load factor, providing more available slots and reducing the likelihood of collisions. This dynamic resizing strategy allows the hash table to adapt to varying workloads and maintain efficient performance even with a growing number of elements.

The load factor in a hash table is the measure of how full the hash table is. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of elements (key-value pairs) currently stored in the hash table to the total number of slots (buckets) available in the hash table. A low load factor indicates that the hash table has plenty of available slots and is not heavily occupied, reducing the likelihood of collisions. On the other hand, a high load factor suggests that many slots are occupied, increasing the chances of collisions.

Lets implement a hash table with load factor management in JavaScript:

class HashTable {
  constructor(initialCapacity = 8) {
    this.buckets = new Array(initialCapacity);
    this.numBuckets = this.buckets.length;
    this.size = 0;
    this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.7; // Set the maximum load factor threshold
  }

  hash(key) {
    let hashValue = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hashValue += key.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return hashValue % this.numBuckets;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const index = this.hash(key);

    if (!this.buckets[index]) this.buckets[index] = [];
    else {
      // Check for duplicate keys and throw an error if found
      for (let i = 0; i < this.buckets[index].length; i++) {
        if (this.buckets[index][i][0] === key) {
          throw new Error('Key already exists');
        }
      }
    }

    this.buckets[index].push([key, value]);
    this.size++;

    const loadFactor = this.size / this.numBuckets;

    if (loadFactor > this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR) {
      this.resize(); // Resize the hash table if the load factor exceeds the threshold
    }
  }

  resize() {
    const oldBuckets = this.buckets;
    this.numBuckets *= 2; // Double the size of the hash table
    this.buckets = new Array(this.numBuckets);
    this.size = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < oldBuckets.length; i++) {
      if (oldBuckets[i]) {
        for (let j = 0; j < oldBuckets[i].length; j++) {
          this.set(oldBuckets[i][j][0], oldBuckets[i][j][1]); // Rehash and insert existing elements
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Other hash table methods...
}

const myHashTable = new HashTable();
myHashTable.set('name', 'John');
myHashTable.set('age', 30);
// Add more key-value pairs to the hash table...
In this code, the set method adds a key-value pair to the hash table. It first calculates the load factor and checks if it exceeds the maximum load factor threshold (this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR). If the load factor is higher than the threshold, it calls the resize method, which increases the size of the hash table and rehashes the existing elements to maintain a low load factor.

By dynamically resizing the hash table and rehashing the elements, we ensure that the load factor stays below a certain threshold, reducing the likelihood of collisions and maintaining efficient performance for hash table operations.

  The load factor in a hash table is a measure that determines when to increase the capacity of the hash table to maintain the efficiency of search and insert operations. It is defined as the ratio of the number of entries (m) to the total size of the hash table (n). The load factor can be calculated as m/n scaler.com.

Maintaining a low load factor helps to reduce the likelihood of collisions. A collision occurs when two different keys hash to the same index in the hash table. If the load factor is high, the table may become cluttered, leading to longer search times and more collisions geeksforgeeks.org.

In JavaScript, you can implement a hash table as a class and manage the load factor as follows:

class HashTable {
  constructor(initialCapacity = 8, loadFactor = 0.75) {
    this.buckets = new Array(initialCapacity);
    this.numBuckets = this.buckets.length;
    this.size = 0;
    this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR = loadFactor;
  }

  // ... other methods ...

  set(key, value) {
    // ... code to add entry ...

    if (this.size / this.numBuckets > this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR) {
      this.resize();
    }
  }

  resize() {
    const oldBuckets = this.buckets;
    this.numBuckets *= 2; // double the size
    this.buckets = new Array(this.numBuckets);
    this.size = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < oldBuckets.length; i++) {
      if (oldBuckets[i]) {
        for (let j = 0; j < oldBuckets[i].length; j++) {
          this.set(oldBuckets[i][j][0], oldBuckets[i][j][1]);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
If the load factor exceeds the specified threshold (0.75 by default in this example), the set method triggers the resize method. The resize method doubles the size of the hash table and rehashes all the existing entries scaler.com.

This process of increasing the size of the hash table and rehashing the elements is also known as rehashing. It helps to distribute the entries evenly across the expanded hash table, maintaining the efficiency of search and insert operations scaler.com.
