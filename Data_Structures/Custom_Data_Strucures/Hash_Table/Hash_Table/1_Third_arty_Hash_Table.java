For Hash Tables in TypeScript, you can use the `Map` object that is part of the JavaScript standard library. While not a third-party library, `Map` provides a simple and efficient way to implement hash tables.

### Map
- **Methods:** `Map` provides methods like `set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`, and `clear` for basic operations. It also has methods like `keys`, `values`, and `entries` for iterating over the keys and values.

- **Basic Properties:** It stores key-value pairs, where keys and values can be of any data type.

- **Usage Patterns:** You can use `Map` to associate values with keys, making it easy to perform lookups, insertions, and deletions in constant time.

- **Best Use Cases:** Ideal for scenarios where you need a simple and flexible key-value store. It's commonly used when you want to associate additional information with an object.

- **Performance Characteristics:** `Map` provides efficient constant-time lookups, insertions, and deletions. It performs well for scenarios where you need to quickly retrieve values based on their keys.

#### Example Usage:
```typescript
// Creating a Map
const myMap = new Map();

// Setting values
myMap.set('key1', 'value1');
myMap.set('key2', 'value2');
myMap.set('key3', 'value3');

// Getting values
console.log(myMap.get('key1')); // Output: value1

// Checking if a key exists
console.log(myMap.has('key2')); // Output: true

// Iterating over keys and values
for (const [key, value] of myMap.entries()) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

// Deleting a key
myMap.delete('key3');
```

Using the built-in `Map` object in TypeScript is recommended for most use cases involving hash tables. If you need additional features or want to explore other libraries, you can look into specialized libraries like **hashmap.js** or **immutable-hashmap**. However, for many applications, the native `Map` object is sufficient and performs well.
