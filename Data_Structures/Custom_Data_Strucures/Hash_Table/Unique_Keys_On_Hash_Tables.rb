  Ensuring uniqueness of keys in a hash table is a crucial aspect of using hash tables effectively. When you insert a key-value pair into a hash table, you typically want to make sure that the key is unique. If the key is not unique, you might accidentally overwrite an existing value.

In JavaScript, you can ensure the uniqueness of keys by checking existence of the key before insertion. Heres how you can modify the set method in the previous example to ensure uniqueness of keys:

Heres how you might implement uniquue at Set method of the HashTable using a class:

class HashTable {
  constructor(initialCapacity = 8) {
    this.buckets = new Array(initialCapacity);
    this.numBuckets = this.buckets.length;
    this.size = 0;
    this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR = 0.75;
  }

  hash(key) {
    let hashValue = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hashValue += key.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return hashValue % this.numBuckets;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const index = this.hash(key);

    if (!this.buckets[index]) {
      this.buckets[index] = [];
    } else {
      for (let i = 0; i < this.buckets[index].length; i++) {
        if (this.buckets[index][i][0] === key) {
          throw new Error('Key already exists');
        }
      }
    }

    this.buckets[index].push([key, value]);
    this.size++;

    if (this.size / this.numBuckets > this.MAX_LOAD_FACTOR) {
      this.resize();
    }
  }


}


In this code, before pushing the new key-value pair into the bucket, we iterate through the existing keys in the bucket and compare them with the new key. If a match is found, an error is thrown. This ensures that no duplicate keys are inserted into the hash table khalilstemmler.com.

However, keep in mind that this approach increases the time complexity of the set method. If the number of entries in a bucket becomes large, the time it takes to insert a new key-value pair also increases. Therefore, its important to maintain a balance between the size of the hash table and the number of entries to ensure efficient operations thedshandbook.com.
