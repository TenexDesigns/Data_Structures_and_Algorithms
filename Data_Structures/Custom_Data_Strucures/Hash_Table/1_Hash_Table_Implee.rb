Hash Table in JavaScript

A hash table, also known as an associative array, is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs and retrieve a value using its associated key. Internally, a hash table uses a hash function to transform a key into an integer index, which then points to the location in memory where the value is stored. This provides fast search, insertion, and deletion operations freecodecamp.org, codecademy.com.

Problem Solved by Hash Table

Hash tables address the problem of quickly storing and retrieving data. They perform insertion, deletion, and searching operations in O(1), i.e., constant time, on average. This makes them extremely efficient for operations that involve frequent lookups, insertions, and deletions geeksforgeeks.org.

Hash Table vs. Object or Map in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the most common examples of hash tables are the Object and Map data types. However, there are some differences:

An Object in JavaScript is a special kind of hash table that comes with additional properties added by the Object class. These additional properties can potentially conflict and overwrite keys you input. Also, the size of the Object is not tracked. You need to manually count how many properties are defined by the programmer instead of inherited from the prototype freecodecamp.org.
A Map in JavaScript is another implementation of a hash table. Unlike Object, Map does not have the issues of property conflicts and size tracking. It preserves the insertion order of keys, which can be beneficial in certain use cases freecodecamp.org.
How to Implement a Hash Table in JavaScript

Heres a basic implementation of a hash table in JavaScript:

class HashTable {
    constructor(size) {
        this.data = new Array(size);
    }

    _hash(key) {
        let hash = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
            hash = (hash + key.charCodeAt(i) * i) % this.data.length;
        }
        return hash;
    }

    set(key, value) {
        let address = this._hash(key);
        if (!this.data[address]) {
            this.data[address] = [];
        }
        this.data[address].push([key, value]);
    }

    get(key) {
        let address = this._hash(key);
        const currentBucket = this.data[address];
        if (currentBucket) {
            for (let i = 0; i < currentBucket.length; i++) {
                if (currentBucket[i][0] === key) {
                    return currentBucket[i][1];
                }
            }
        }
        return undefined;
    }
}
In this example, we create a HashTable class with a set method to insert key-value pairs and a get method to retrieve values by their keys. The _hash method is a private method that generates a hash for each key freecodecamp.org.

Where Hash Tables are Used

Hash tables are a common data structure in software engineering and can be found or influenced in the design and implementation of:

Databases: Hash tables are used in databases to quickly find a data record given its search key.
Caching strategies: Hash tables are used in caching where data is stored temporarily for quick access.
Language-defined implementations: Languages like Java, Python, and TypeScript have their own language-defined implementations of hash tables khalilstemmler.com.
