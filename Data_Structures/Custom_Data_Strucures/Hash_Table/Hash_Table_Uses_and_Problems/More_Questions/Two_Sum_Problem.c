Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 








-------------------------

To determine if two arrays have common elements using a hash table (also known as an object in JavaScript), you can follow these steps:

1. Create a hash table (object) to store the elements of the first array.
2. Iterate through the second array and check if each element exists in the hash table.

Heres the code to achieve this:

```javascript
function haveCommonElements(array1, array2) {
  const hashTable = {}; // Create an empty hash table

  // Populate the hash table with elements from the first array
  for (const element of array1) {
    hashTable[element] = true;
  }

  // Iterate through the second array and check for common elements
  for (const element of array2) {
    if (hashTable[element]) {
      return true; // Found a common element
    }
  }

  return false; // No common elements
}

const array1 = [3, 4, 5];
const array2 = [9, 7, 5];

const result = haveCommonElements(array1, array2);
console.log(result); // true (because 5 is a common element)
```

**Reasoning:**

Using a hash table (object) for this task has several advantages:

1. **Efficiency:** Similar to using a Set, hash tables allow for fast lookups. Checking if a key exists in an object has an average time complexity of O(1), making it efficient for checking whether an element exists.

2. **Uniqueness:** Just like with Sets, hash tables handle uniqueness automatically. Duplicates are automatically removed, and only unique elements are considered.

3. **Memory Efficiency:** Hash tables can be more memory-efficient than Sets, especially when dealing with larger data sets.

4. **Custom Logic:** Hash tables provide flexibility in terms of associating values with keys, which can be useful if you need to track additional information about elements.

Using a hash table in this scenario provides an efficient and straightforward solution for finding common elements between two arrays. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the arrays, making it a highly performant solution.
