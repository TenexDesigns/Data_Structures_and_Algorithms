To find the length of the largest subarray with a sum of 0 in an array using JavaScript, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `maxLen` to 0 to store the maximum length of the subarray.
2. Create an empty Map or HashMap to store the cumulative sum of the elements and their corresponding indices.
3. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative sum of the elements.
4. Iterate over each element `num` in the array:
   - Add the current element `num` to the cumulative sum `sum`.
   - If `num` is 0 and `maxLen` is 0, update `maxLen` to 1. This handles the case when the maximum length subarray is a single element of value 0.
   - If `sum` is 0, update `maxLen` to the current index + 1. This handles the case when the subarray from the beginning of the array to the current index has a sum of 0.
   - Check if `sum` exists in the map. If it does, update `maxLen` to the maximum value between `maxLen` and the difference between the current index and the index stored in the map for the cumulative sum `sum`.
   - If `sum` does not exist in the map, store the current index as the value for the cumulative sum `sum` in the map.
5. Return `maxLen` as the length of the largest subarray with a sum of 0.

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above algorithm:

```javascript
function maxLen(arr) {
  let maxLen = 0;
  let sum = 0;
  const map = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
    
    if (arr[i] === 0 && maxLen === 0) {
      maxLen = 1;
    }

    if (sum === 0) {
      maxLen = i + 1;
    }

    if (map.has(sum)) {
      maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - map.get(sum));
    } else {
      map.set(sum, i);
    }
  }

  return maxLen;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [15, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 10, 23];
const length = maxLen(arr);
console.log("Length of the largest subarray with sum 0:", length);
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates over the array once and performs constant time operations for map operations and comparisons.
