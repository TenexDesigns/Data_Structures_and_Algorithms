To solve this problem in O(n) time complexity, you can use a hash set to efficiently keep track of the elements and their consecutive sequences. Here's how you can approach this problem using JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestConsecutive(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let longestStreak = 0;
    
    for (const num of numSet) {
        if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            let currentNum = num;
            let currentStreak = 1;
            
            while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum += 1;
                currentStreak += 1;
            }
            
            longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, currentStreak);
        }
    }
    
    return longestStreak;
}

// Example usage
const nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2];
console.log(longestConsecutive(nums)); // Output: 4 (sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a hash set `numSet` to store the unique elements from the input array `nums`.

2. Initialize a variable `longestStreak` to keep track of the maximum consecutive sequence length.

3. Iterate through each element `num` in the `numSet`. For each `num`, check if `num - 1` is not present in the set. If not, it means `num` is the starting point of a possible consecutive sequence.

4. Initialize `currentNum` with `num` and `currentStreak` with 1. Then, use a while loop to increment `currentNum` and `currentStreak` as long as the next consecutive element exists in the set.

5. Update `longestStreak` with the maximum of its current value and `currentStreak`.

6. After iterating through all elements, return `longestStreak`, which will be the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

**Reasoning:**

The key idea behind this solution is to use a hash set to efficiently check for the presence of elements and their consecutive sequences. By iterating through the elements, you can identify potential starting points of consecutive sequences and use a while loop to extend those sequences. This approach ensures O(n) time complexity since each element is processed only once, and each sequence is extended only once.

The hash set allows constant time lookups and insertions, making the overall solution efficient. The algorithm iterates through each element once, and for each element, it checks and extends the consecutive sequence if applicable. This ensures that the solution runs in linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.

To find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array of integers in JavaScript, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Handle the base case of an empty array by returning 0.
2. Create a Set to store the unique elements of the array.
3. Initialize a variable `max` to store the maximum length of the consecutive sequence.
4. Iterate over each element `num` in the set:
   - Check if `num - 1` exists in the set. If it does, skip to the next iteration, as we want to start the sequence from the smallest element.
   - Initialize a variable `currNum` with the value of `num` and a variable `currMax` with 1, as we have found the starting element of a sequence of length 1.
   - Use a while loop to check if `currNum + 1` exists in the set. If it does, increment `currNum` and `currMax` by 1.
   - Update `max` with the maximum value between `max` and `currMax`.
5. Return `max` as the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the above algorithm:

```javascript
var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
    // Handle base case of empty array
    if (!nums.length) return 0;
    // Create a set of unique elements
    const set = new Set(nums);
    let max = 0;
    for (const num of set) {
        // Make sure we are starting at the beginning of the sequence
        if (set.has(num - 1)) continue;
        let currNum = num;
        let currMax = 1;
        // Look for numbers that make a consecutive sequence
        while (set.has(currNum + 1)) {
          currNum++;
          currMax++;
        }
        // Update max
        max = Math.max(max, currMax);
    }
    return max;
};
```

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) since it iterates over the array and performs constant time operations for set operations and comparisons.
