Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 < numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 










-----------------------------
Sure, I can help you solve this problem in JavaScript. The problem is asking you to find two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a specific target number and return their indices (1-indexed).

Here's the solution:

```javascript
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        
        if (sum === target) {
            return [left + 1, right + 1]; // Adding 1 to make the indices 1-indexed
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return [];
}
```

Explanation and Reasoning:

1. Were using a two-pointer approach, where `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end of the array.

2. At each step, we calculate the sum of the elements at indices `left` and `right`.

3. If the sum is equal to the target, we found the two numbers. We return the indices `left + 1` and `right + 1` as the answer since the indices are 1-indexed.

4. If the sum is less than the target, we increment `left` to consider larger numbers.

5. If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement `right` to consider smaller numbers.

6. We continue the process until we find the target sum or until `left` is greater than or equal to `right`.

7. If we reach a point where `left` is greater than or equal to `right`, it means there is no solution, and we return an empty array.

The reasoning behind this solution is that since the array is sorted, we can start with the smallest and largest elements and move towards the middle based on the comparison of the current sum with the target. This way, we narrow down the search space and find the required pair efficiently.

Example:

Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`

- `left = 0` (index of 2), `right = 3` (index of 15), `sum = 2 + 15 = 17 > 9`, so decrement `right`.
- `left = 0`, `right = 2` (index of 11), `sum = 2 + 11 = 13 > 9`, so decrement `right`.
- `left = 0`, `right = 1` (index of 7), `sum = 2 + 7 = 9`, which is the target, so return `[1, 2]`.
The solution efficiently finds the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target using a constant amount of extra space and a single pass through the array.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
Certainly! Lets use the provided array `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11]` and the same two-pointer approach to find two numbers that add up to a specific target.

Given array: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11]`
Target: `12`

Heres how the solution works step by step:

1. Initialize `left` to `0` (index of `1`) and `right` to `6` (index of `11`).

2. Calculate the sum of the elements at `left` and `right`: `1 + 11 = 12`. Since the sum is equal to the target, we have found the solution. Return `[left + 1, right + 1]`, which is `[1, 7]`.

The indices `1` and `7` correspond to the elements `1` and `11` in the array. Their sum is indeed equal to the target `12`, so the solution is `[1, 7]`.

In this case, the solution was found in a single step because the sum of the first and last elements of the array equals the target. This demonstrates the efficiency of the two-pointer approach, which takes advantage of the sorted nature of the array to quickly narrow down the search space and find the solution.
