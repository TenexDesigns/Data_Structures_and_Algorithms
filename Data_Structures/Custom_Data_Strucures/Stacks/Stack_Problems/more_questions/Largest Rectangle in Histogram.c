Largest Rectangle in Histogram
---------------------------


The problem of finding the largest rectangle in a histogram involves analyzing a histogram, which is a bar chart representation of data. Here's an explanation of the concepts and the solution:

1. Histogram: A histogram is a graphical representation of data that consists of a series of bars. Each bar represents a range of values, and the height of the bar represents the frequency or count of data within that range.

2. Rectangle: In the context of the problem, a rectangle is formed by the bars in the histogram. It is defined by its height and width. The height of the rectangle is determined by the height of the bar, and the width is determined by the number of consecutive bars that can be included in the rectangle.

3. Qualifying and Disqualifying Rectangles: A rectangle qualifies if it can be formed by consecutive bars in the histogram. It disqualifies if there is a bar with a smaller height that prevents the rectangle from extending further.

4. Extending a Rectangle: A rectangle can be extended to the left or right as long as the bars in that direction have a height greater than or equal to the current height of the rectangle.

5. Area Calculation: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its height by its width. In the context of the problem, the width is determined by the number of consecutive bars included in the rectangle.

To solve this problem, you can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars in the histogram. Heres a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable to store the maximum area.
2. Iterate through each bar in the histogram.
3. If the stack is empty or the current bars height is greater than the height of the bar at the top of the stack, push the index of the current bar onto the stack.
4. If the current bars height is less than or equal to the height of the bar at the top of the stack, start popping bars from the stack until a bar with a smaller height is encountered.
5. For each popped bar, calculate the area of the rectangle that can be formed using the popped bar as the smallest bar. Update the maximum area if necessary.
6. After iterating through all the bars, if there are any bars remaining in the stack, repeat step 5 for each remaining bar.
7. Return the maximum area.

Here's the code implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
  const stack = [];
  let maxArea = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i <= heights.length; i++) {
    const currentHeight = i === heights.length ? 0 : heights[i];

    while (stack.length > 0 && currentHeight < heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
      const height = heights[stack.pop()];
      const width = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
      const area = height * width;
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
    }

    stack.push(i);
  }

  return maxArea;
}
```

The reasoning behind this solution is to use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars in the histogram. By iterating through the bars and maintaining the stack, we can identify the qualifying rectangles and calculate their areas. The maximum area is updated whenever a larger area is found.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram, as we iterate through each bar once.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

The "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" problem involves finding the largest rectangular area that can be formed within a given histogram. In this context:

1. **Histogram**: A histogram is a graphical representation of data distribution, where each bar represents the frequency of data within a specific range.

2. **Rectangle**: A rectangle in this problem is formed by the bars of the histogram. Its defined by its height (the height of the smallest bar within the rectangle) and its width (the number of consecutive bars included).

3. **Qualifying a Rectangle**: A rectangle qualifies if it can be formed by consecutive bars in the histogram. The height of the rectangle is determined by the height of the smallest bar within the chosen range of bars.

4. **Disqualifying a Rectangle**: A rectangle is disqualified if it extends beyond the histogram boundaries or if a smaller bar height is encountered that limits the rectangle's height.

5. **Extending a Rectangle**: A rectangle can be extended by including consecutive bars to the left and/or right if their heights are greater than or equal to the current rectangle's height.

6. **Area Calculation**: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its height by its width.

7. **Holes**: Holes refer to empty spaces between bars in the histogram that prevent the formation of a continuous rectangle.

To solve this problem efficiently, you can use a stack to keep track of the indices of bars in increasing order of their heights. The stack helps determine the width of the rectangle as you pop elements from it.

Here's a step-by-step solution with JavaScript code:

```javascript
function largestRectangleArea(heights) {
    const stack = [];
    let maxArea = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i <= heights.length; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && (i === heights.length || heights[i] < heights[stack[stack.length - 1]])) {
            const height = heights[stack.pop()];
            const width = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return maxArea;
}

// Test case
const histogram = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3];
console.log(largestRectangleArea(histogram)); // Output: 10
```

**Reasoning behind the Solution:**

The solution uses a stack to efficiently calculate the largest rectangle area. It iterates through the histogram bars, and for each bar, it pops elements from the stack while maintaining the increasing order of heights. This ensures that it calculates the maximum area that can be formed by the bars that are popped.

For each popped bar, the width of the rectangle is calculated as the difference between the current index `i` and the index at the top of the stack. The height of the rectangle is the height of the popped bar. The maximum area is updated if the calculated area is greater than the current maximum.

By maintaining the stack in increasing order of heights, the algorithm can efficiently calculate the largest rectangle area by considering various possible combinations of bars. This approach ensures that all possibilities are explored while avoiding unnecessary calculations.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram, and the space complexity is O(n) due to the stack.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A histogram is a graphical representation of data using bars of different heights. Each bar represents a specific category or range of values, and the height of the bar represents the frequency or count of data points falling within that category or range.

In the context of the problem, a histogram is represented by an array of integer heights. The width of each bar is assumed to be 1. The problem asks for the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram.

To qualify as a rectangle in this problem, the shape must meet the following criteria:

- The sides of the rectangle must be parallel to the x and y axes.
- The rectangle must be fully contained within the histogram, meaning no part of it can extend beyond the boundaries of the given heights array.

The extendability of a rectangle in this problem depends on the following conditions:

- The rectangle can be extended to the left as long as there is a bar to the left with a height greater than or equal to the current bar's height.
- The rectangle can be extended to the right as long as there is a bar to the right with a height greater than or equal to the current bar's height.

The area of a rectangle in different scenarios can be calculated as follows:

- If the rectangle is being extended to the left, the area is calculated as the current bar's height multiplied by the difference between the current index and the index of the bar to the left of the current bar in the stack.
- If the rectangle is being extended to the right, the area is calculated as the current bar's height multiplied by the difference between the current index and the index of the bar to the right of the current bar in the stack.

Holes in the histogram refer to gaps or spaces between bars where the height is zero or there are no bars present. These holes break the continuity of the histogram and can affect the calculation of the largest rectangle area.

The direction in which a rectangle can be extended is determined by the following conditions:

- If the current bar's height is greater than or equal to the height of the bar at the top of the stack, the rectangle can be extended to the right.
- If the current bar's height is less than the height of the bar at the top of the stack, the rectangle can be extended to the left.

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty stack and set the maximum area to 0.
2. Iterate through the heights array from left to right.
3. For each bar, compare its height with the height of the bar at the top of the stack.
   - If the current bar's height is greater than or equal to the height of the bar at the top of the stack, push its index into the stack.
   - If the current bar's height is less than the height of the bar at the top of the stack, calculate the area of the rectangle using the height and width of the previous bar in the stack. Update the maximum area if necessary.
4. After the iteration, calculate the area of any remaining bars in the stack that have not been processed. Update the maximum area if necessary.
5. Return the maximum area as the result.

Here is an example implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function largestAreaInHistogram(height) {
  let stack = [-1]; // Initialize stack with a sentinel value
  let maxArea = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
    while (stack[stack.length - 1] !== -1 && height[stack[stack.length - 1]] >= height[i]) {
      const currentHeight = height[stack.pop()];
      const currentWidth = i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
      maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentHeight * currentWidth);
    }
    stack.push(i);
  }

  while (stack[stack.length - 1] !== -1) {
    const currentHeight = height[stack.pop()];
    const currentWidth = height.length - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentHeight * currentWidth);
  }

  return maxArea;
}

const height = [5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 5];
console.log("Maximum area is", largestAreaInHistogram(height));
```

This solution utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of the indices of the bars in non-decreasing order of their heights. The stack helps identify the boundaries of the rectangle that can be formed using each bar as the smallest bar.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram. This is because each bar is processed once and pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear.
