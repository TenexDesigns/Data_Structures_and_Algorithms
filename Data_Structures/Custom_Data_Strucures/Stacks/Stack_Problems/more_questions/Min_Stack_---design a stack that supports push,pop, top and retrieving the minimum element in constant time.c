------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, you can use two stacks: one for storing the elements and another for storing the minimum elements. The idea is to keep track of the minimum element at each step so that when you push or pop elements, you can also update the minimum stack accordingly.

Heres the implementation of the Min Stack in JavaScript:

```javascript
class MinStack {
    constructor() {
        this.stack = [];
        this.minStack = []; // To store minimum elements
    }

    push(val) {
        this.stack.push(val);

        // Update the minimum stack
        if (this.minStack.length === 0 || val <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.push(val);
        }
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.stack.length === 0) return;

        const popped = this.stack.pop();

        // Update the minimum stack
        if (popped === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    top() {
        if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
        return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
    }

    getMin() {
        if (this.minStack.length === 0) return null;
        return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
    }
}

// Test the MinStack
const minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);

console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: -3
console.log(minStack.pop());
console.log(minStack.top());    // Output: 0
console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: -2
```

**Explanation:**

- `stack`: This stack stores the elements as they are pushed onto the stack.
- `minStack`: This stack stores the minimum elements at each step. When an element is pushed onto the stack, if it's less than or equal to the top element of `minStack`, it's also pushed onto `minStack`. This ensures that the top of `minStack` always holds the minimum element up to that point.
- `push(val)`: This method pushes the given value onto the `stack`. It also checks if the value is less than or equal to the top element of `minStack` and updates `minStack` accordingly.
- `pop()`: This method pops the top element from `stack`. If the popped element is the same as the top element of `minStack`, it's also popped from `minStack`.
- `top()`: This method returns the top element of `stack` without popping it.
- `getMin()`: This method returns the top element of `minStack`, which represents the minimum element in the stack.

The reasoning behind this solution is that by maintaining the minimum elements separately in `minStack`, you can retrieve the minimum element in constant time (`O(1)`), which is a key requirement of the problem. The extra space used by `minStack` ensures that you can always access the minimum element efficiently, even when other elements are pushed or popped from the main `stack`.




Second Approach
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************8
To solve the problem of designing a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, you can follow the approach outlined in the search results:

1. Create a class called `MinStack` that will implement the stack functionality.

2. In the `MinStack` class, define two variables:
   - `s` - an array to store the stack elements
   - `minEle` - a variable to store the current minimum element in the stack

3. Implement the `push` function to insert elements into the stack:
   - If the stack is empty, set `minEle` as the new element and insert it into the stack.
   - If the new element is less than `minEle`, insert `(2 * x - minEle)` into the stack and update `minEle` as the new element.
   - Otherwise, insert the new element into the stack.

4. Implement the `pop` function to remove the top element from the stack:
   - If the stack is empty, print a message indicating that the stack is empty.
   - If the top element is equal to `minEle`, update `minEle` as `(2 * minEle - top)` before removing the element from the stack.
   - Otherwise, simply remove the top element from the stack.

5. Implement the `top` function to retrieve the top element of the stack:
   - If the stack is empty, print a message indicating that the stack is empty.
   - Otherwise, return the top element of the stack.

6. Implement the `getMin` function to retrieve the minimum element in the stack:
   - If the stack is empty, print a message indicating that the stack is empty.
   - Otherwise, return `minEle`.

Here is the code implementation of the `MinStack` class in JavaScript:

```javascript
class MinStack {
  constructor() {
    this.s = [];
    this.minEle;
  }

  push(x) {
    if (this.s.length === 0) {
      this.minEle = x;
      this.s.unshift(x);
      console.log("Number Inserted: ", x);
      return;
    }

    if (x < this.minEle) {
      this.s.unshift(2 * x - this.minEle);
      this.minEle = x;
    } else {
      this.s.unshift(x);
    }

    console.log("Number Inserted: ", x);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.s.length === 0) {
      console.log("Stack is empty");
      return;
    }

    let top = this.s[0];
    this.s.shift();

    if (top === this.minEle) {
      console.log(this.minEle);
      this.minEle = 2 * this.minEle - top;
    } else {
      console.log(top);
    }
  }

  top() {
    if (this.s.length === 0) {
      console.log("Stack is empty");
      return;
    }

    console.log("Top Most Element is: ", this.s[0]);
  }

  getMin() {
    if (this.s.length === 0) {
      console.log("Stack is empty");
      return;
    }

    console.log("Minimum Element in the stack is: ", this.minEle);
  }
}

// Example usage
let s = new MinStack();
s.push(-2);
s.push(0);
s.push(-3);
s.getMin(); // Output: -3
s.pop();
s.top(); // Output: 0
s.getMin(); // Output: -2
```

This implementation of the `MinStack` class in JavaScript ensures that the minimum element can be retrieved in constant time, using an additional stack to store the minimum elements. The code handles push, pop, top, and getMin operations on the stack efficiently.

Please note that the code provided is a direct implementation of the algorithm described in the search results.
  You can further modify and optimize the code as per your specific requirements.





MORE APPRACHES
**************************************************************************************************************************************************************8
  Sure! To design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time, we can use an additional stack to keep track of the minimum elements. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Start by defining a class called `MinStack` to represent the stack.

2. Initialize two arrays, `stack` and `minStack`, as properties of the `MinStack` class. The `stack` array will store the actual elements, and the `minStack` array will store the minimum elements.

3. Implement the `push` method to add an element to the stack:
   - If the `minStack` is empty or the new element is less than or equal to the current minimum element, push the new element to both `stack` and `minStack`.
   - Otherwise, only push the new element to `stack`.

4. Implement the `pop` method to remove the top element from the stack:
   - If the top element of `stack` is equal to the top element of `minStack`, pop both elements from `stack` and `minStack`.
   - Otherwise, only pop the top element from `stack`.

5. Implement the `top` method to retrieve the top element of the stack:
   - Return the top element of `stack`.

6. Implement the `getMin` method to retrieve the minimum element in the stack:
   - Return the top element of `minStack`.

Here's the JavaScript code implementation:

```javascript
class MinStack {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
    this.minStack = [];
  }

  push(x) {
    if (this.minStack.length === 0 || x <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.push(x);
    }
    this.stack.push(x);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return;
    if (this.stack[this.stack.length - 1] === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.pop();
    }
    this.stack.pop();
  }

  top() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
  }

  getMin() {
    if (this.minStack.length === 0) return null;
    return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
  }
}

// Example usage:
const minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(3);
minStack.push(1);
console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: 0
minStack.pop();
console.log(minStack.top());    // Output: 3
console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: 0
```

In this solution, we maintain two stacks: `stack` for storing the elements and `minStack` for storing the minimum elements. By using these two stacks, we can achieve constant time complexity for retrieving the minimum element.

When pushing new elements, we check if the `minStack` is empty or if the new element is less than or equal to the current minimum element. If so, we push the new element to both `stack` and `minStack`. Otherwise, we only push it to `stack`.

When popping elements, we check if the top element of `stack` is equal to the top element of `minStack`. If they are the same, it means the top element is the minimum, so we pop both elements. Otherwise, we only pop the top element from `stack`.

Retrieving the top element is straightforward, we simply return the last element of `stack`. Similarly, retrieving the minimum element is done by returning the last element of `minStack`.

This implementation ensures that the minimum element is always accessible in constant time through the `getMin` method.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
