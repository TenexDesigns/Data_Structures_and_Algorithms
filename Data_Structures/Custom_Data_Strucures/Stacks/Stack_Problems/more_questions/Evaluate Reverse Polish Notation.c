"You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation."How do I solve this problem, a nd what is the resonong behind the solution, explain with code implememntiion iin javascript





SOLUTION
*************************************************8
To evaluate a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression in JavaScript, you can use the following approach:

1. Create a stack to store the operands.
2. Iterate over each token in the RPN expression.
3. If the token is a number, push it onto the stack.
4. If the token is an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/'), pop the top two operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
5. After iterating through all the tokens, the final result will be the only element remaining in the stack.
6. Return the result.

Here's the code implementation based on the provided sources:

```javascript
function evaluateRPN(tokens) {
  const stack = [];

  for (const token of tokens) {
    if (!isNaN(token)) {
      stack.push(parseInt(token));
    } else {
      const operand2 = stack.pop();
      const operand1 = stack.pop();

      switch (token) {
        case '+':
          stack.push(operand1 + operand2);
          break;
        case '-':
          stack.push(operand1 - operand2);
          break;
        case '*':
          stack.push(operand1 * operand2);
          break;
        case '/':
          stack.push(Math.trunc(operand1 / operand2));
          break;
        default:
          throw new Error('Invalid operator');
      }
    }
  }

  return stack.pop();
}

// Example usage:
const tokens = ['5', '3', '6', '*', '+', '5', '3', '/', '-', '7', '+'];
const result = evaluateRPN(tokens);
console.log(result); // Output: 26
```

In this implementation, we use a stack to store the operands. We iterate over each token in the RPN expression. If a token is a number, we push it onto the stack. If a token is an operator, we pop the top two operands from the stack, perform the corresponding operation, and push the result back onto the stack. At the end, the final result is the only element remaining in the stack.

To evaluate an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), you can use a stack to keep track of operands and perform operations when encountering operators. The idea is to iterate through the array of tokens and push operands onto the stack. When you encounter an operator, you pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack. In the end, the stack will contain the final result of the expression.

Here's how you can implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function evalRPN(tokens) {
    const stack = [];

    for (const token of tokens) {
        if (!isNaN(token)) { // Check if the token is an operand
            stack.push(parseInt(token));
        } else { // Token is an operator
            const operand2 = stack.pop();
            const operand1 = stack.pop();

            switch (token) {
                case '+':
                    stack.push(operand1 + operand2);
                    break;
                case '-':
                    stack.push(operand1 - operand2);
                    break;
                case '*':
                    stack.push(operand1 * operand2);
                    break;
                case '/':
                    stack.push(Math.trunc(operand1 / operand2));
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    return stack[0];
}

// Test the implementation
const tokens1 = ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]; // Output: 9
const tokens2 = ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]; // Output: 6
const tokens3 = ["10", "6", "9", "3", "/", "*", "+"]; // Output: 17

console.log(evalRPN(tokens1));
console.log(evalRPN(tokens2));
console.log(evalRPN(tokens3));
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create an empty stack to store operands.

2. Iterate through the `tokens` array.

3. If the current token is a number (operand), convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.

4. If the current token is an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack (two operands for binary operators like '+', '-', '*', '/', etc.).

5. Perform the operation based on the operator and the two operands, and push the result back onto the stack.

6. Continue iterating through the `tokens` array until all tokens are processed.

7. Finally, the stack will contain only one element, which is the final result of the expression. Return that value.

This approach efficiently evaluates the RPN expression by using a stack to keep track of operands and perform operations. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the input array.
