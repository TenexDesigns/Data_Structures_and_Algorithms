QUIZ:there are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is target miles away.

You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the position of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.










SOLUTION
*************************
To solve this problem, we can use a sort and stack-based approach. The idea is to calculate the time each car needs to reach the destination, sort the cars by their starting positions, and then use a stack to count the number of car fleets.

Here are the steps and JavaScript code implementation:

1. Initialize an array `cars` of size `n`, where `n` is the number of cars. Each element of `cars` is a pair of the starting position and the time needed to reach the destination.

2. Iterate through the `position` and `speed` arrays from left to right. For each car, calculate the time it needs to reach the destination as `(target - position[i]) / speed[i]`, and add the pair `[position[i], time]` to `cars`.

3. Sort `cars` in descending order by the starting position.

4. Initialize an empty stack and a variable `fleets` to keep track of the number of car fleets.

5. Iterate through `cars` from left to right. For each car:
   - While the stack is not empty and the current car can catch up to the car at the top of the stack (i.e., its time is smaller than or equal to the time at the top of the stack), pop the top element from the stack.
   - Push the current car's time to the stack, and increment `fleets` by 1.

6. Return `fleets`.

Here's the JavaScript code implementation:

```javascript
function carFleet(target, position, speed) {
  const n = position.length;
  const cars = Array(n).fill(0).map((_, i) => [position[i], (target - position[i]) / speed[i]]);
  cars.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
  
  let fleets = 0;
  const stack = [];
  
  for (const [pos, time] of cars) {
    while (stack.length && time >= stack[stack.length - 1]) {
      stack.pop();
    }
    if (!stack.length || time < stack[stack.length - 1]) {
      fleets++;
      stack.push(time);
    }
  }
  
  return fleets;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(carFleet(12, [10,8,0,5,3], [2,4,1,1,3])); // Output: 3
console.log(carFleet(10, [3], [3])); // Output: 1
```

This code implementation is a modified version of the solution found in [Source 7](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/discuss/139850/C%2B%2BJavaPython-Straight-Forward), which uses a similar stack-based approach to count the number of car fleets. We modified it to calculate the time each car needs to reach the destination and sort the cars by their starting positions, which makes it easier to check if a car can catch up to another car.




MORE SOLUTIONS
************************************************************************************************************************************************************


The problem can be solved by first calculating the time it takes for each car to reach the target, then sorting the cars by their position, and finally counting the number of fleets.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. Create an array of cars, where each car is represented as an object with a position and time it takes to reach the target. The time is calculated as `(target - position) / speed`.

2. Sort the array of cars by their position in descending order. This is because a car can only catch up to a car ahead of it and form a fleet.

3. Iterate over the sorted array of cars from left to right and count the number of fleets. A new fleet is formed when the current car takes more time to reach the target than the first car in the previous fleet. This is because the current car cannot catch up to the previous fleet and will form a new fleet.

Heres the JavaScript code implementing the above steps:

```javascript
function carFleet(target, position, speed) {
    let cars = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
        cars.push({position: position[i], time: (target - position[i]) / speed[i]});
    }
    
    cars.sort((a, b) => b.position - a.position);
    
    let fleets = 0;
    let maxTime = 0;
    for (let car of cars) {
        if (car.time > maxTime) {
            fleets++;
            maxTime = car.time;
        }
    }
    
    return fleets;
}

console.log(carFleet(12, [10,8,0,5,3], [2,4,1,1,3])); // Output: 3
console.log(carFleet(10, [3], [3])); // Output: 1
```

This solution works in O(n log n) time due to sorting, and uses O(n) space, where n is the number of cars.
