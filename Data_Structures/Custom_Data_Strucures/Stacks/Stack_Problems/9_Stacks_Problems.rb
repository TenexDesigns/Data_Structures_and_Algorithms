Sure, here are some more problems and tasks solved using stacks and algorithms with code samples:

22. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation (RPN):
   - Problem: Given an array of strings representing a Reverse Polish Notation expression, evaluate the expression and return the result. Operators can be '+', '-', '*', or '/' and only contain integers.
   - Algorithm: Use a stack to keep track of operands. Traverse the array, and if an element is an operator, pop two operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back to the stack. If the element is an integer, push it onto the stack. Finally, the result will be the only element left in the stack.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
function evalRPN(tokens) {
  const stack = [];
  const operators = new Set(['+', '-', '*', '/']);

  for (let token of tokens) {
    if (operators.has(token)) {
      const num2 = stack.pop();
      const num1 = stack.pop();
      switch (token) {
        case '+':
          stack.push(num1 + num2);
          break;
        case '-':
          stack.push(num1 - num2);
          break;
        case '*':
          stack.push(num1 * num2);
          break;
        case '/':
          stack.push(parseInt(num1 / num2));
          break;
      }
    } else {
      stack.push(parseInt(token));
    }
  }

  return stack[0];
}

console.log(evalRPN(['2', '1', '+', '3', '*'])); // Output: 9 (2 + 1 * 3 = 9)
console.log(evalRPN(['4', '13', '5', '/', '+'])); // Output: 6 (4 + 13 / 5 = 6)
```

23. Min Stack:
   - Problem: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
   - Algorithm: Use two stacks - one to store elements and another to keep track of the minimum elements. Whenever a new element is pushed, compare it with the top of the minimum stack, and if it is smaller, push it onto the minimum stack as well. For pop operations, check if the top of the element stack is equal to the top of the minimum stack; if yes, pop from the minimum stack too.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
class MinStack {
  constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
    this.minStack = [];
  }

  push(value) {
    this.stack.push(value);
    if (
      this.minStack.length === 0 ||
      value <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]
    ) {
      this.minStack.push(value);
    }
  }

  pop() {
    const value = this.stack.pop();
    if (value === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.pop();
    }
    return value;
  }

  top() {
    return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
  }

  getMin() {
    return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
  }
}

const minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: -3
minStack.pop();
console.log(minStack.top()); // Output: 0
console.log(minStack.getMin()); // Output: -2
```

24. Trapping Rain Water:
   - Problem: Given an array representing the heights of bars, where each bar has width 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the bars.
   - Algorithm: Use a stack to keep track of the indices of bars. Traverse the array, and if the current height is smaller than the height of the bar at the top of the stack, push the index to the stack. If the current height is greater, calculate the trapped water between the bars using the height difference and width (distance between the current index and the index at the top of the stack). Continue this process until all bars are processed.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
function trap(height) {
  const stack = [];
  let water = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
    while (stack.length > 0 && height[i] > height[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
      const top = stack.pop();

      if (stack.length === 0) {
        break;
      }

      const distance = i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
      const boundedHeight = Math.min(height[i], height[stack[stack.length - 1]]) - height[top];
      water += distance * boundedHeight;
    }

    stack.push(i);
  }

  return water;
}

console.log(trap([0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1])); // Output: 6


```

These are additional problems and tasks solved using stacks and algorithms. Stacks are versatile data structures that find applications in a wide range of algorithmic challenges and real-world problems. They are commonly used for expression evaluation, tracking minimum elements, and solving water trapping problems, among others.
