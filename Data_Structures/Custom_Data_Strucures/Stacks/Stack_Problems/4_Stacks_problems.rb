Certainly! Here are a few more problems and tasks solved using stacks and algorithms with code samples:

7. Balanced Parentheses:
   - Problem: Check if a given string of parentheses is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order.
   - Algorithm: Use a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. When encountering a closing parenthesis, check if it matches the top element in the stack. If it does, pop the top element; otherwise, the string is unbalanced.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
function isBalancedParentheses(str) {
  const stack = [];

  for (let char of str) {
    if (char === '(') {
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (char === ')') {
      if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== '(') {
        return false;
      }
    }
  }

  return stack.length === 0;
}

console.log(isBalancedParentheses("((()))")); // Output: true
console.log(isBalancedParentheses("(()))")); // Output: false
```

8. Reverse String Using Stack:
   - Problem: Reverse a given string using a stack.
   - Algorithm: Push each character of the string onto the stack and then pop them in reverse order to obtain the reversed string.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let char of str) {
    stack.push(char);
  }

  let reversedStr = '';
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    reversedStr += stack.pop();
  }

  return reversedStr;
}

console.log(reverseString("hello")); // Output: "olleh"
```

9. Stock Span Problem:
   - Problem: Given an array of stock prices for consecutive days, find the span of each stock's price. The span of a stock's price on a given day is the number of consecutive days before the current day for which the stock price is less than or equal to the current day's price.
   - Algorithm: Use a stack to keep track of the indices of previously seen stock prices. When processing a new stock price, pop the indices from the stack until a stock price greater than the current day's price is found, and then calculate the span.
   - Code Sample:

```javascript
function stockSpan(prices) {
  const stack = [];
  const spans = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    while (stack.length > 0 && prices[stack[stack.length - 1]] <= prices[i]) {
      stack.pop();
    }
    spans[i] = stack.length === 0 ? i + 1 : i - stack[stack.length - 1];
    stack.push(i);
  }

  return spans;
}

console.log(stockSpan([100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85])); // Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
```

These are some additional problems and tasks solved using stacks and algorithms. Stacks are versatile data structures that can be utilized to solve various computational problems efficiently.
