Stacks and algorithms involving stacks are widely used to solve various problems in computer science and real-world applications. Here are some common problems and tasks that can be solved using stacks and stack-based algorithms:

1. Balanced Parentheses:
   - Check if a given expression containing parentheses is balanced or not.
   - Example: `(()[{}])` is balanced, while `([)]` is not balanced.

2. Infix to Postfix Conversion:
   - Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
   - Example: Infix `2 + 3 * 4` becomes postfix `2 3 4 * +`.

3. Evaluate Postfix Expressions:
   - Evaluate a given postfix expression to obtain the result using a stack.
   - Example: Postfix `2 3 4 * +` evaluates to `14`.

4. Tower of Hanoi:
   - Solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a stack-based algorithm.
   - Move a tower of disks from one peg to another peg with the restriction that a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.

5. Reverse a String:
   - Reverse a given string using a stack.

6. Check Palindromes:
   - Check if a given string is a palindrome using a stack.

7. Expression Evaluation:
   - Evaluate arithmetic expressions involving operators (+, -, *, /) and parentheses using stacks.

8. Depth-First Search (DFS):
   - Implement DFS on a graph using a stack to traverse through vertices.

9. Backtracking Algorithms:
   - Various backtracking algorithms, such as finding all possible combinations, permutations, or solutions to a problem, can utilize stacks for tracking the search space.

10. Call Stack in Programming Languages:
    - In programming languages, a call stack is a stack data structure that tracks function calls during program execution.

11. Undo/Redo Mechanism:
    - Implement an undo/redo mechanism in an application using two stacks to store changes.

12. Browser History:
    - Implementing a browser history using a stack to track visited pages.

These are just a few examples of problems and tasks that can be solved using stacks and stack-based algorithms. Stacks are versatile data structures that play a crucial role in various algorithms, including parsing expressions, graph traversal, and solving puzzles and search problems. They are widely used in computer science, software development, and many real-world applications to efficiently manage and process data.
