What learning path to follow?
Beginners
Start with the basic data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues. Implement each one, understand how every operation works (adding elements, deleting elements, searching), and the time complexity for each operation.

Intermediate
Graduate to Trees, Hash Tables, and Graphs. Learn different types of trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees) and understand tree traversals. Implement and understand different graph algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search).

Advanced
Move to more advanced data structures and algorithms like Red-Black Trees, B-Trees, Binomial and Fibonacci Heaps, Union-Find, tries, and understand their suitability for different problems.

Remember, mastering data structures requires consistency, effort, and a lot of practice. It is okay to find concepts challenging initially, but with regular learning and practice, these concepts can become second nature. Good luck on your journey of mastering data structures.
