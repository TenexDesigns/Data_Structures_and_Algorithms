In JavaScript, a Set is a collection of unique values, where each value can occur only once. It is similar to an array, but it only stores distinct elements. 
Heres a breakdown of the key points and methods related to JavaScript Sets:

Creating a Set:
You can create a Set in three ways:
By passing an array to the new Set() constructor.
By creating an empty Set and then using the add() method to add values.
By creating an empty Set and then using the add() method to add variables.
javascript
Copy code
// Creating a Set by passing an Array to the constructor
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);

// Creating an empty Set and adding values
const letters = new Set();
letters.add("a");
letters.add("b");
letters.add("c");

// Creating an empty Set and adding variables
const a = "a";
const b = "b";
const c = "c";
const letters = new Set();
letters.add(a);
letters.add(b);
letters.add(c);
Set Methods:

add(value): Adds a new element to the Set. If the value already exists, it wont be added again.
delete(value): Removes an element from the Set.
has(value): Returns true if the value exists in the Set.
clear(): Removes all elements from the Set.
forEach(callback): Invokes a callback for each element in the Set.
values(): Returns an Iterator object with all the values in the Set.
keys(): Same as values(). (Sets dont have keys like Maps.)
entries(): Returns an Iterator object with the [value, value] pairs from the Set.
Properties:

size: Property that returns the number of elements in the Set.
Differences between JavaScript Objects and Sets:

Sets are directly iterable, while objects are not.
Sets have a size property, while objects do not.
Set keys (values) can be any data type, while object keys must be strings or symbols.
Set keys are ordered based on insertion, while object keys are not well-ordered.
Sets do not have default keys.
Iterating through a Set:

You can use the forEach method or an Iterator to access the elements of a Set.
javascript
Copy code
// Using forEach
const letters = new Set(["a", "b", "c"]);
letters.forEach((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});

// Using an Iterator
const myIterator = letters.values();
for (const value of myIterator) {
  console.log(value);
}
In summary, JavaScript Sets provide a simple way to store unique values without duplicates. They are iterable, and you can use various methods to add, remove, and access the elements. Sets are commonly used when you need to ensure that each element is unique in a collection.
