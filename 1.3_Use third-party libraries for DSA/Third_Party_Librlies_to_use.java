Sure, here are some popular third-party data structure libraries for TypeScript that you can use for linked lists:

| Library | Methods | Basic Properties | Usage Patterns | Best Use Cases | Performance Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| lodash-ts | A comprehensive library that provides a variety of utilities for working with arrays, objects, strings, and more, including functions for creating, traversing, and manipulating linked lists. | Dynamically sized, supports both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists, efficient insertion and deletion operations | Data manipulation, algorithm implementation, representing sequential data | General-purpose data structure library, well-suited for a wide range of applications | Efficient for basic linked list operations, may have overhead for some complex operations |
| fp-ts | A library that focuses on functional programming concepts and provides a rich collection of data structures and functions for working with immutable data, including functions for creating and manipulating linked lists. | Immutable, supports both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists, provides methods for mapping, filtering, and reducing linked lists | Functional programming applications, data manipulation with immutability constraints | Well-suited for pure functional programming, provides efficient immutability support |
| typescript-collections | A lightweight library that offers a variety of data structures, including sorted maps, sets, and queues, along with functions for creating and manipulating linked lists. | Efficient memory management, supports both singly linked lists and doubly linked lists, provides methods for traversal and manipulation | Data representation, algorithm implementation, general-purpose data structure library | Efficient for basic linked list operations, lightweight and easy to use |

These libraries provide a variety of methods for working with linked lists, including:

* `createLinkedList`: Creates a new linked list
* `insert`: Inserts a new element into the linked list
* `delete`: Removes an element from the linked list
* `search`: Searches for an element in the linked list
* `traverse`: Traverses the linked list and performs an operation on each element
* `toArray`: Converts the linked list to an array

The basic properties of linked lists include:

* `Dynamically sized`: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
* `Efficient insertion and deletion`: Inserting and deleting elements from linked lists is typically more efficient than with arrays, as it does not require shifting elements.
* `Node-based structure`: Linked lists consist of nodes, each of which contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The usage patterns of linked lists include:

* `Representing sequential data`: Linked lists are often used to represent sequential data, such as a list of items or a queue of tasks.
* `Implementing algorithms`: Linked lists are used in a variety of algorithms, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables.
* `General-purpose data structure`: Linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for a variety of purposes, including data manipulation, algorithm implementation, and data representation.

The best use cases for linked lists include:

* `When frequent insertion and deletion are required`: Linked lists are a good choice for applications where frequent insertion and deletion are required, as these operations are more efficient with linked lists than with arrays.
* `When memory usage is a concern`: Linked lists can be more memory-efficient than arrays, as they do not require contiguous blocks of memory.
* `When representing a dynamic sequence of data`: Linked lists are well-suited for representing dynamic sequences of data, as they can grow and shrink as needed.

The performance characteristics of linked lists include:

* `Efficient insertion and deletion`: Inserting and deleting elements from linked lists is typically more efficient than with arrays, as it does not require shifting elements.
* `Memory overhead`: Linked lists may have some memory overhead due to the need to store pointers to the next node in the list.
* `Cache performance`: Linked list performance can be affected by cache locality, as accessing elements in a linked list may result in more cache misses than accessing elements in an array.

To use a third-party data structure library for linked lists in TypeScript, you will need to first install the library using the npm command. For example, to install the lodash-ts library, you would run the following command:

```
npm install lodash-ts
```

Once the library is installed, you can import it into your TypeScript file and start using its methods. For example, the following code snippet creates a new linked list and inserts three elements into the list:

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash-ts';

const list = _.LinkedList.create();
list.insert(10);
list.insert(20);
list.insert(30);
```

This code will create a new linked list with the values 10, 20, and 30. You can use the other methods provided by the library to traverse, manipulate, and search
